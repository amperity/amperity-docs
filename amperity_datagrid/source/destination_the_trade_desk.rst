Get details
==================================================

.. destination-the-trade-desk-get-details-start

|destination-name| requires the following configuration details:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 0

   * - .. image:: ../../images/steps-check-off-black.png
          :width: 60 px
          :alt: Detail one.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - Configuration details for |destination-name|.

       * The advertiser ID
       * The advertiser secret

       .. tip:: You can find the advertiser ID and secret key from the management console within |destination-name|. Open **Preferences**, and then **First Party Data Credentials**. The advertiser ID and secret key are shown there.

       .. important:: Your brand must have a UID 2.0 agreement in-place with |destination-name| before configuring this destination.

   * - .. image:: ../../images/steps-check-off-black.png
          :width: 60 px
          :alt: Detail two.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - The name of a segment in |destination-name|.

       Membership duration defines the length of time (in days) at which individual audience members will belong to the segment in |destination-name|. The minimum value should be "7" because |destination-name| uses the previous seven days when building audiences. "14" is the default duration. The maximum value is "180".

       .. tip:: Set this value to "0" to remove all audience members.

       .. caution:: The membership duration is measured in days. Adjust the membership duration value to be greater than (or equal to) than the frequency at which your brand will send campaigns or orchestrations from Amperity.

          For example, if your brand sends a campaign to |destination-name| every 30 days, then the membership duration should be set to "30". If your brand sends a campaign every 14 days, then the membership duration should be set to "14".

          If a campaign is sent every 30 days, but the membership duration is 14, then the audience size for the last 16 days of the duration window will be 0.

          :class: no-scaled-link
     - You may use a query to build the list of email addresses or you may select the **email** attribute from the attribute editor in your campaigns.

       .. important:: The **email** column is required and may not be aliased.

       **Example query**

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - **The Trade Desk offline events only**

       A tracking tag name must be provided. The value for the tracking tag name is a string with a maximum of 256 characters. The tracking tag name will appear in the UI for |destination-name| exactly as it is entered in the configuration for a destination in Amperity that is configured to send offline events to |destination-name|.

       .. important:: The tracking tag name must be unique across all offline tracking tags, especially if shared between an advertiser and an offline provider. The tracking tag name must not duplicate any previous name for the same advertiser and offline data provider ID.

          |destination-name| uses a combination of the tracking tag name, your brand's advertiser ID, and offline data provider ID to build an offline tracking tag ID your brand can use to help measure the success of your marketing campaigns.

       A :ref:`query that defines the set of offline events <destination-the-trade-desk-offline-events-build-query>` to be sent to |destination-name|.

       Optional. You may define a segment name and membership duration (in days) for individual audience members. These may be left blank, and then specified with a data template.

       .. tip:: The membership duration is measured in days. The minimum value should be "7" because |destination-name| uses the previous seven days when building audiences. "14" is the recommended duration, but this value should be greater than (or equal to) the frequency at which your brand sends campaigns or orchestrations to |destination-name|.

          For example, if your brand sends a campaign to |destination-name| every 30 days, then the membership duration should be set to "30". If your brand sends a campaign every 14 days, then the membership duration should be set to "14".

          Set this value to "0" to clear out the audience in the segment.

          * - **Setting**
            - **Description**
          * - **Tracking tag name**
            - A tracking tag name must be provided. The value for the tracking tag name is a string with a maximum of 256 characters. The tracking tag name will appear in the UI for |destination-name| exactly as it is entered in the configuration for a destination in Amperity that is configured to send offline events to |destination-name|.

              .. important:: The tracking tag name must be unique across all offline tracking tags, especially if shared between an advertiser and an offline provider. The tracking tag name must not duplicate any previous name for the same advertiser and offline data provider ID.

                 |destination-name| uses a combination of the tracking tag name, your brand's advertiser ID, and offline data provider ID to build an offline tracking tag ID your brand can use to help measure the success of your marketing campaigns.

Rows that are sent to |destination-name| that do not have a UID 2.0 value or have an empty value are removed by |destination-name|.

          You may use **uid2** as an attribute when Amperity is configured as a |uid2_operator| for your brand.

       For example:

       .. code-block:: sql

          ,country AS country
          ,state AS region

       .. tip:: Use a **WHERE** clause to limit query results to only offline events that occurred in specific states.

       For example:

       .. code-block:: sql

       If you don't need to track offline events by individual physical stores, you may use a purchase channel to define this value. For example:

          ,purchase_channel AS storeid


   * - **TD1** - **TD10**

Within the **SELECT** statement, return **Order Datetime**, and then rename it to the field name required by |destination-name|.

       For example:

       .. code-block:: sql

          ,order_datetime AS timestamp


   * - **uid2**

       You may use **uid2** as an attribute when Amperity is configured as a |uid2_operator| for your brand.

          WHERE uit.order_datetime > (CURRENT_DATE - interval '25' day)


   * - **value**
     - **Recommended**

       The monetary value of the offline event to your brand. The value for this field must be a decimal.

       .. note:: This field should be included with offline events to help |destination-name| deduplicate conversion events.

       For retail-focused offline events this is most often the **Order Value** field in the **Unified Transactions** table, but it may be from a different table depending on your use case and/or how your brand has configured Amperity. Within the **SELECT** statement, return **Order Value**, and then rename it to the field name required by |destination-name|.

   * By sending an email to support@amperity.com

   After the Amperity data assets Amazon S3 bucket is enabled, use a courier to pull individual data assets from that location to your tenant using an Amazon S3 data source.

.. data-asset-files-request-to-enable-end


.. _data-asset-address-standardization:

Address standardization
--------------------------------------------------

.. data-asset-address-standardization-start

Address standardization is a list of address variations for state and street names. Use this data asset with :doc:`address-based householding <householding>` workflows.

.. data-asset-address-standardization-end

**To add the address standardization data asset**

.. data-asset-address-standardization-steps-start

Add the address standardization data asset to your tenant by pulling the file that is available from **Amperity Data Assets**, which is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket that can be made available to your tenant. Follow the steps for :ref:`adding a data source and feed <source-amazon-s3-add-data-source>`. Click **Browse** and select the "address_standardization_conversion.csv" file from the **Amperity Data Assets** Amazon S3 bucket. This file is located in the "householding" directory in the bucket.

Use all three fields – **before**, **convert**, and **type** as the primary key.

.. note:: If Amperity data assets credentials are not available on your tenant, make a request to Amperity Support to enable Amperity data assets for your tenant.

Add a passthrough table to your customer 360 database named **LookupTables AddressStandardization**, and then run your customer 360 database to build the **LookupTables AddressStandardization** table.

.. important:: The **LookupTables AddressStandardization** table is used within the **Merged Households** SQL template in a series of LEFT JOIN operations that are used to standardize addresses. For example:

          .. code-block:: sql

             LEFT JOIN (
               SELECT
                 UPPER(before) AS before
                 ,UPPER(convert) AS converted
               FROM LookupTables_AddressStandardization
               WHERE type = 'STREET'
             ) AS a7clean ON (a7clean.before = core.a7)

          You can name this table *anything* else, such as **Address Standardization USA**. If you use the **Merged Households** SQL template, you will need to update the LEFT JOIN sections within that template to contain the updated table name.

.. data-asset-address-standardization-steps-end


.. _data-asset-gender-name-ratios:

Gender name ratios
--------------------------------------------------

.. data-asset-gender-name-ratios-link-start

Use the gender name ratios data asset to use :doc:`gender prediction <predict_gender>` to apply personalization strategies to your marketing campaigns.

.. data-asset-gender-name-ratios-link-end

.. data-asset-gender-name-ratios-start

The **gender_name_ratios.csv** file contains a list of baby names from the past ~130 years, along with their associated gender.

The source of the data in the **gender_name_ratios.csv** file is from United States Social Security Administration records for |baby_names|. These records were used to generate the **gender_name_ratios.csv** file, which is similar to:

.. code-block:: text

   given_name,predicted_gender,gender_name_ratio,male_count,female_count
   EMILIA,F,7178.6,5,35893
   THERESE,F,7025.0,5,35125
   AILEEN,F,6969.8,5,34849
   ...
   LINDSEY,F,20.2,7710,156111
   MORRISON,M,20.2,1496,74
   ROLLA,M,20.1,1306,65

The most important column is **gender_name_ratio**, which describes what proportion of **given_name** is associated with one gender versus the other.

.. note:: Only names with a ratio greater than 20 are included. This ensures that any prediction has a ~95% chance of being accurate based on the given name.

   Only names with at least 1000 male or female examples were included. This filters out very uncommon names.

.. data-asset-gender-name-ratios-end

**To add the gender name ratios data asset**

.. data-asset-gender-name-ratios-steps-start

Add the gender name ratios data asset to your tenant by pulling the file that is available from **Amperity Data Assets**, which is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket that can be made available to your tenant. Follow the steps for :ref:`adding a data source and feed <source-amazon-s3-add-data-source>`. Click **Browse** and select the "gender_name_ratios.csv" file from the **Amperity Data Assets** Amazon S3 bucket.

Use **given_name** as the primary key.

.. note:: If Amperity data assets credentials are not available on your tenant, make a request to Amperity Support to enable Amperity data assets for your tenant.

You can add predicted gender to your customer 360 database in two ways, depending on how your brand wants to use predicted gender to build segments:

#. Extend the **Customer 360** and/or **Merged Customers** tables to include predicted gender (recommended).
#. Add predicted gender values to your customer 360 database as a standalone table.

**Extend the Merged_Customers table (recommended)**

.. note:: The steps are the same for both the **Customer 360** and **Merged Customers** tables.

   Edit the **Merged Customers** table and extend the table for predicted gender.

Use a common table expression (CTE) to pull data from the domain table that contains predicted gender data ("Predictions_Gender"):

.. code-block:: sql

   predict_gender AS (
     SELECT
       mc.amperity_id
       ,CASE
         WHEN UPPER(ratios.predicted_gender) = 'M' THEN 'Male'
         WHEN UPPER(ratios.predicted_gender) = 'F' THEN 'Female'
         ELSE ratios.predicted_gender
       END AS predicted_gender
     FROM Merged_Customers AS mc
     LEFT JOIN Predictions_Gender AS ratios
     ON UPPER(
       COALESCE(mc.given_name, SPLIT(mc.full_name,' ')[0])
     ) = ratios.given_name
   ),

Update the list of columns in the **Merged Customers** table to include predicted gender and combined gender:

.. code-block:: sql

   ,pg.predicted_gender
   ,COALESCE(mc.gender,pg.predicted_gender) AS combined_gender

.. note:: The combined gender column uses the value from the **gender** column in the **Merged Customers** table when a value exists, and then uses the value from the **predicted_gender** column if the **gender** column in the **Merged Customers** table is empty. 

Use a **LEFT JOIN** to join the values from the common table expression to the **Merged Customers** table:
 
.. code-block:: sql

   LEFT JOIN predict_gender pg ON pg.amperity_id = mc.amperity_id

**Add a table for predicted gender (optional)**

Your brand's use cases for predicted gender may prefer using a standalone table.

#. Add a passthrough table to your customer 360 database named **Gender Name Ratios**.
#. Add a SQL table to your customer 360 database named **Predicted Gender**.
#. Choose **SQL** as the build mode, and then use SQL similar to:

   .. code-block:: sql

      WITH ratios AS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM Gender_Name_Ratios 
        WHERE gender_name_ratio >= 100
      )

      SELECT
        mc.amperity_id
        ,ratios.predicted_gender
      FROM Merged_Customers AS mc
      LEFT JOIN Gender_Name_Ratios AS ratios
      ON UPPER(
        COALESCE(mc.given_name, SPLIT(mc.full_name,' ')[0])
      ) = ratios.given_name

   where "100" represents a 99% accuracy threshold. Increase or decrease this value as necessary.

   .. tip:: This table will be unique by Amperity ID and may be made available to the **Segment Editor** for use with campaigns.

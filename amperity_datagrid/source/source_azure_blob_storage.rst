Azure credentials
--------------------------------------------------

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-credentials-start

A source that uses |source-name| credentials may use a connection string, a shared access signature, or a storage URI.

       **Connection string**

       This method uses a connection string and the name of the container from which Amperity will pull data.

       **Shared access signature**

       This method uses the Microsoft Azure account name, a shared access signature, and the name of the container from which Amperity will pull data.

       .. tip:: When using a shared access signature, create a policy in Microsoft Azure, and then generate a token for the shared access signature against that policy. This allows the policy to expire instead of the token. Manage the expiration of the token by managing the expiration of the policy.

       **Storage URI**

       This method uses the storage URI and the name of the container from which Amperity will pull data.

   :end-before: .. term-azure-data-share-end

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-start

Amperity prefers to pull data from customer-managed cloud storage. This approach ensures that customers can:

* Use security policies managed in Azure Data Share to manage access to data
* Directly manage the files that are made available
* Modify access without requiring involvement by Amperity; access may be revoked at any time by either Azure account, after which data sharing ends immediately
* Directly troubleshoot incomplete or missing files

Amperity recommends to use Azure Data Share to manage access to customer-managed cloud storage in Azure. This allows managed security policies to control access to data.

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-end

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-after-start

After setting up Azure Data Share, a list of files (by filename and file type), along with any sample files, must be made available to allow for feed creation. These files may be placed directly into the shared location after Azure Data Share is configured.

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-after-end

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-remove-start

.. note:: Data that is shared with Amperity via Azure Data Share can be removed from Amperity by submitting a request for data removal to Amperity Customer Support.

**To send data to Amperity using Azure Data Share**

.. source-azure-blob-storage-configure-azure-data-share-steps-start

The following steps describe how to configure Amperity to use Azure Data Share to pull data from customer-managed Azure Blob Storage.

.. important:: These steps require configuration changes to both customer- *and* Amperity-managed Azure accounts and must be done by users with administrative access.

Add data source and feed
==================================================

.. source-azure-blob-storage-add-data-source-intro-start-start

Add a data source that pulls data from an |source-name| bucket for each file that you want to pull to Amperity.

Browse the |source-name| bucket to select a file, and then review the settings for that file. Define the feed schema, and then activate the feed. Run the courier manually, and then review the data that is added to the domain table that is associated with the feed.

       Click **Browse** to open the **File browser**. Select the file that will be pulled to Amperity, and then click **Accept**.

       Use a filename pattern to define files that will be loaded on a recurring basis, but will have small changes to the filename over time, such as having a datestamp appended to the filename.

       .. note:: For a new feed, this file is *also* used as the sample file that is used to define the schema. For an existing feed, this file must match the schema that has already been defined.

       The contents of the file may be previewed as a table and in a raw format. Switch between these views using the **Table** and **Raw** buttons, and then click **Refresh** to view the file in that format.

       .. note:: PGP encrypted files can be previewed. Apache Parquet PGP encrypted files must be less than 500 MB to be previewed.

       Amperity will infer formatting details, and then adds these details to a series of settings located along the left side of the file view. File settings include:

       * Delimiter
       * Compression
       * Escape character
       * Quote character
       * Header row

       Review the file, and then update these settings, if necessary.

       .. note:: Amperity supports the following file types: |format_avro|, |format_parquet|, |format_csv|, DSV, |format_json|, |format_ndjson|, |format_psv|, |format_tsv|, and |format_xml|.

          Refer to those reference pages for details about each of the individual file formats.

          Files that contain nested JSON (or "complex JSON") or XML may require using the legacy courier configuration.

     - A feed defines the schema for a file that is loaded to Amperity, after which that data is loaded into a domain table and ready for use with workflows within Amperity.

       There are two options for feeds: use a new feed or use an existing feed.


       **Use a new feed**

       To use a new feed, choose the **Create new feed** option, select an existing source from the **Source** drop-down *or* type the name of a new data source, and then enter the name of the feed.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-new.png

          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       After you choose a load type and save the courier configuration, you will configure the feed using the data within the sample file.


       **Use an existing feed**

       To use an existing feed, choose the **Use existing feed** option to use an existing schema.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-existing.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       This option requires this file to match all of the feed-specific settings, such as incoming field names, field types, and primary keys. The data within the file may be different.


       **Load types**

       The load type defines how data in the file will be loaded to the associated domain table.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-load-type.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Use the **Truncate and load** option to delete all rows in the associated domain table prior to loading data.

       Use the **Load** option to load data from the selected file to the associated domain table.

       .. note:: When a file is loaded to a domain table using an existing file, the file that is loaded *must* have the same schema as the existing feed. The data in the file may be new.

          :alt: Step 6.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - Use the feed editor to do all of the following:

       * Set the primary key
       * Choose the field that best presents when the data in the table was last updated; if there is not an obvious choice, use the "Generate an updated field" option.
       * For each field in the incoming data, validate the field name and semantic tag columns in the feed. Make any necessary adjustments.
       * For tables that contain customer records, enable the "Make available to Stitch" to ensure the values in this data source are used for identity resolution.

       When finished, click **Activate**.

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - Find the courier related to the feed that was just activated, and then run it manually.

       On the **Sources** page, under **Couriers**, find the courier you want to run and then select **Run** from the actions menu.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-courier-add-07-menu-run.png

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Select a date from the calendar picker that is before today, but after the date on which the file was added to the |source-name| bucket.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-courier-add-07-menu-load-data.png

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Leave the load options in the **Run courier** dialog box unselected, and then click **Run**.

       After the courier has run successfully, inspect the domain table that contains the data that was loaded to Amperity. After you have verified that the data is correct, you may do any of the following:

       * If the data contains customer records, edit the feed and make that data available to Stitch.
       * If the data should be loaded to Amperity on a regular basis, add the courier to a courier group that runs on the desired schedule.
       * If the data will be a foundation for custom domain tables, use Spark SQL to build out that customization.

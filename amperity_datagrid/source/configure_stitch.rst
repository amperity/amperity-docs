Stitch configuration is defined from a list of settings in the **Stitch settings** dialog box, which is available from the **Stitch** page in Amperity. Stitch settings can be accessed by users who are assigned to the **DataGrid Administrator** policy.

The default settings are recommended for most situations.

General settings
==================================================

.. TODO: Do not change this title; may be linked to from a tooltip in the application and also the left-side navigation.

.. configure-stitch-general-start

The **General** settings tab contains a series of configuration settings that may be modified based on analysis of the data in your tenant to help improve data quality and clustering results.

General settings are divided into the following categories:

* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-clustering`
* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-performance`
* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-stitch`

The following settings determine how Stitch returns clusters of records:

* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-clustering-blocking`
* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-clustering-case-sensitive`
* :ref:`configure-stitch-general-clustering-matching-strategy`

.. configure-stitch-general-clustering-blocking-start

The combination of blocking keys is what creates the ideal recall rate without compromising the performance of Amperity.

* An overly generous blocking strategy may result in a high recall rate (too many pairs being evaluated) along with negative system performance.
* An overly conservative blocking strategy may result in a low recall rate (too few pairs being evaluated).
* Individual blocking keys may be conservative or generous.

.. configure-stitch-general-clustering-blocking-end

.. configure-stitch-general-clustering-blocking-default-start

To configure the blocking strategies that are used for your tenant, open the **Stitch** page, and then click **Stitch settings**. In the list of settings, under **Cluster quality**, select one (or more) blocking strategies from the **Blocking Strategies** drop-down:

   :start-after: .. tooltip-stitch-config-matching-thresholds-start
   :end-before: .. tooltip-stitch-config-matching-thresholds-end

.. configure-stitch-general-clustering-matching-thresholds-start

Based on the precision and recall rate that was observed in the initial Stitch results, the matching threshold can be tuned to achieve better results by updating the weakest match category to can be included in Stitch results.

In general, a lower threshold will lead to more matches and fuzzier matched pairs, whereas a higher threshold will lead to fewer matches and more precise matched pairs. For the default ordinal classifier, five different thresholds can be chosen, and they are defined as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 200
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Threshold
     - Weakest Match
   * - 1.0
     - Weak
   * - 2.0
     - Moderate
   * - 3.0 
     - High
   * - 4.0
     - Excellent
   * - 5.0
     - Exact

For each threshold, all the matches that are equal to or stronger than the weakest matching type will be clustered together. For example, if the threshold 3.0 is chosen, 

To change the matching threshold, open the **Stitch** page, and then click **Stitch settings**. In the list of settings, under **Cluster quality**, select a matching threshold from the **Thresholds** drop-down:

.. configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-explore-start

As new data is input to Amperity, the Stitch process identifies when new or changed data applies to existing clusters of customer records, and then updates those records, maintains the cluster, and `retains a stable Amperity ID assignment <https://docs.amperity.com/stitch.html#stable-id-assignment>`__. A new Amperity ID is only created when new individuals are identified.

.. configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-explore-end

.. configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-start

Stable ID assignment can be a resource-intensive process, in particular when:

#. Adding data sources that contain large numbers of rows (100+ million rows) of customer records.
#. Updating existing data sources with large numbers of rows on a periodic (monthly, quarterly, etc.) basis.
#. Data contains a very large number of duplicate values, such as 400k+ instances of an email address that is associated to a common business process.

You can configure the stable ID assignment process in the following ways:

#. :ref:`Disable stable IDs <configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-disable>`
#. :ref:`Increase the number of partitions that are available to stable ID assignment <configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-partitions>`

.. _configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-partitions:

Increase partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. configure-stitch-general-stitch-stable-id-partitions-start

When large differences are present between clusters of records for the current and previous Stitch runs you can increase the number of partitions that are used by Stitch during stable ID assignment. This situation can occur when data sources provide periodic updates, such as monthly, quarterly, etc., that contain a very large number of rows.

By default, stable ID assignment is based on the edges that exist between current and previous clusters of customer records, weighted by the number of shared primary keys. The shared primary keys are sorted in descending order, after which ties are broken by sorting the cluster IDs in ascending order. Edges are removed when higher-ranked edges are associated to identical clusters of customer records. Edges that survive this ranking are then used to map current cluster IDs to previous cluster IDs. Changes to stable ID assignment are captured in the **Unified Changes Clusters** and **Unified Changes PKs** tables.

In some cases, the differences between the current and previous clusters of customer records is very large, requiring access to a large amount of memory to complete the stable ID assignment process. In this type of situation Stitch processes may take a very long time, or even appear to be stuck; in some cases the Stitch job has run out of memory and will need to be rerun. In these situations, do the following:

#. Look for unusual values, such as a large set of identical email address, that appear in the **Unified Coalesced** table. This can sometimes be the cause of slow stable ID assignment. Mitigate the presence of these unusual values, and then run Stitch again.
#. Increase the number of partitions that are available to Stitch during the stable ID assignment process. You can increase the value of **stable-id-partition-count** to a value between 2-10 to improve the performance of Stitch during stable ID assigment.

This setting should be used temporarily, but for some tenants it may need to be left at a non-default value. Changing partitions may only be done using an advanced configuration setting:

.. important:: If Stitch has already been run in standard mode, and then if one-to-one mode is enabled, there will be 100% jitter. Amperity IDs are not expected to be the same between standard and one-to-one Stitch runs.

Use the following steps to configure your tenant for one-to-one Stitch:

#. Ensure that each table that is made available to Stitch applies the **ck** semantic tag to the field that contains the existing customer ID.

   .. tip:: You may apply the **ck** semantic tag from a feed or from a custom domain table.

#. Apply all other semantic tags -- customer profile, foreign key, primary key, orders and items -- to the correct fields in all of your data sources. These tags will have no effect when running one-to-one Stitch, but are required Amp360 (customer profiles and transactions) and AmpIQ (segment insights and predictive modeling).

#. To configure Amperity for one-to-one Stitch, open the **Stitch** page, and then click **Stitch settings**. In the list of settings, under **Bypass Stitch**, move the slider for the **Run 1:1 Stitch** setting to the right:

Many email addresses are not useful for identity resolution. Some of them are generic, such as *info@some-domain.com*, and are often associated with a place of business and are never associated with a unique individual. Other email addresses are bogus, having been entered as a requirement for providing a genuine email address, but are otherwise fake, such as *123@some-domain.com*.

   :start-after: .. tooltip-stitch-config-supersized-clusters-start
   :end-before: .. tooltip-stitch-config-supersized-clusters-end

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-supersized-clusters-example-start

A supersized cluster is created when multiple transitive connections are present across clusters of records. For example, individuals named Mary Johnson and Jeffrey Johnson with the following records:

#. Mary Johnson, maryjohnson @gmail.com, 50 1st Avenue, New York, NY, with 50 connected records.
#. Jeffrey Johnson, jeffjohnson @gmail.com, 50 1st Avenue, New York, NY, with 25 connected records.
#. Mary Johnson, mjohnson50 @gmail.com, 50 1st Avenue, New York, NY, with 17 connected records.
#. Jeffrey Johnson, mjohnson50 @gmail.com, 50 1st Avenue, New York, NY, with 8 connected records.

These records block together in the following ways:
   
* Records 1 and 3 block together on name and address.
* Records 2 and 4 block together on name and address.
* Records 3 and 4 block together on email.

All four groups of records transitively connect into a single connected cluster with a size of 100.

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-supersized-clusters-example-end

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-supersized-clusters-start

Amperity defines a supersized cluster as any cluster with 64 (or more) connections. To change this threshold to a higher or lower value, update the following advanced configuration setting:

.. code-block:: clojure

   :amperity.stitch.settings/supersized-cluster-min-size 64

The following table represents a set of records that contain enough matching PII to associate all of these records to a single unique individual:

.. code-block:: mysql

   ------- ----------- ---------- ----------------- ------ ------------------------

However, not all of the PII is identical. The email addresses do not match across all of the records. The trivial duplication process will collapse the identical records down, leaving the following set of records:

.. code-block:: mysql

   ------- ----------- ---------- ----------------- ------ ------------------------
    pk      FirstName   LastName   Address           ...    Email

   ------- ----------- ---------- ----------------- ------ ------------------------

The complete set of records (including trivial duplicates) will be available in the **Unified Coalesced** table. The collapsed records will be available in the **Unified Preprocessed Raw** table.

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-trivial-duplicate-qualified-start
   :end-before: .. term-trivial-duplicate-qualified-end

Qualified trivial duplicates are treated as a single record by downstream Stitch processes and are truncated from the **Unified Preprocessed Raw** table.

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-example-end

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-admonition-start

.. admonition:: What are the rep_ds and rep_pk columns?

   Use the **rep_pk** and **rep_ds** columns in the **Unified Coalesced** table to help with situations where it's necessary to understand why two records were not clustered together.

   .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
      :start-after: .. term-rep-ds-start
      :end-before: .. term-rep-ds-end

   The combination of **rep_ds** and **rep_pk** represent qualified trivial duplicates that were discovered by Stitch early in the identity resolution process.

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-admonition-end

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-setting-start

The advanced configuration setting for trivial duplicates is:

.. code-block:: clojure

   :amperity.stitch.settings/soft-trivial-dupe-size-threshold 10

An increase to this value will decrease the likelihood that multiple records with trivial differences are collapsable into a single record for the identity resolution process. This setting should only be tuned after understanding the quality of downstream data, including stitched records.

.. _configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-exclusions:

Semantic exclusions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-exclusions-start

Semantic exclusions for trivial duplicates may be specified. When excluded, for the purpose of identifying clusters of records, the values associated with that semantic will be ignored. This should only be done for limited scenarios where certain types of data are known to be of lower quality.

To define an exclusion, add the following advanced configuration setting for Stitch:

.. code-block:: clojure

   :amperity.stitch.settings/soft-trivial-dupe-semantic-exclusions #{"semantic_name"}

where **semantic_name** is a the name of a semantic, such as **email**. (This value is **nil** by default.)

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-exclusions-end

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-example-start

The following table represents a set of records that contain enough PII that should identify a single unique individual:

   ------- ----------- ---------- ----------------- ------ ------------------------

All of the information is identical, except for variations in email addresses that causes each of them to be unique. Because the email addresses are not identical, Amperity will not collapse them into a single record for identity resolution purposes even when it is obvious that all of these records are the same individual.

The maximum allowed number of records with trivial duplicates is set to "10" by default. When the number of records with trivial duplicates is greater than this value, each individual record will be treated as a single record. Since the previous example shows eleven records for Justin Currie, each with a unique value for the email column, eleven individual records would be created.

Semantic exclusions define a threshold over which records like these will be collapsed into a trivial duplicate. For example, let's say you have defined a semantic exclusion for **email** and left the size threshold at "10".

For each unique combination of PII--excluding email addresses!--the distinct email addresses that are associated with that unique combination of PII are compared. If there are more than 10 distinct email addresses, those records are collapsed into a trivial duplicate.

.. _configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-example:

Example: email addresses
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. configure-stitch-advanced-profile-trivial-duplicates-example-start

A long-running promotion for a free food item results in a large number of email addresses associated with the same first name, last name, and phone number. This results in a large number of nearly-identical records, each with a unique email address. You can use semantic exclusions to define a threshold over which records like this are collapsed into a trivial duplicate.

Configure Stitch to define a semantic exclusion for email addresses:

::

   :amperity.stitch.settings/soft-trivial-dupe-semantic-exclusions #{"email"}

and then define the threshold:

::

   :amperity.stitch.settings/soft-trivial-dupe-size-threshold 25


For each unique combination of PII--excluding email addresses!--the distinct email addresses that are associated with that unique combination of PII are compared. If there are more than 25 distinct email addresses, those records are collapsed into a trivial duplicate.

Stitch reports
--------------------------------------------------

.. TODO: Do not change this title; may be linked to from a tooltip in the application and also the left-side navigation.

.. configure-stitch-advanced-reports-start

A Stitch report shows cluster graphs for individuals associated with the Amperity ID. You can configure the Stitch report to include or exclude specific Amperity IDs. Ensuring that certain Amperity IDs are included (or excluded) can help improve the quality of the Stitch report. The Amperity IDs that are included will appear first in the series of individuals shown when exploring Amperity IDs.

Stitch may be configured to include or exclude specific Amperity IDs in the Stitch report.

* Use **:amperity.stitch-report.example/exclude** to define a list of Amperity IDs to be excluded from the report.
* Use **:amperity.stitch-report.example/include** to define a list of Amperity IDs to be included in the report.

.. TODO: Make this an actual task.

These settings are available from the **Stitch** page. Click **Configure**, add the list of Amperity IDs to be included or excluded under **Stitch report configuration**, and then run Stitch.

For example:

.. code-block:: clojure

   {
     :amperity.stitch-report.example/exclude
       [

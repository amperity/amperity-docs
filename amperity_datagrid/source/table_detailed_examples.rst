        Detailed Examples table

Detailed Examples table

.. table-detailed-examples-automatically-added-start

The **Detailed Examples** table is automatically added to the Stitch QA database as a SQL table when it is generated using the "Stitch QA" database template.

.. _table-detailed-examples-use-with-stitch-qa:

Use with Stitch QA
==================================================

.. table-detailed-examples-use-with-stitch-qa-start

Use the **Detailed Examples** table as part of the Stitch QA process to return a detailed set of examples that show you what is in your customer 360 database. Use this data to identify which types of features lead to scores with the largest effect on overall Stitch results, including how those features are associated with various combinations of fields that contain profile (PII) data.

.. _table-detailed-examples-use-with-stitch-qa-configure:

Configure query
--------------------------------------------------

.. table-detailed-examples-use-with-stitch-qa-configure-start

The **Detailed Examples** query should be configured to match the fields that are in your tenant. Open this table in the **Database Editor** in edit mode and make the following updates:

#. Uncomment rows of matching a/b pairs or add new rows so that the uncommented rows match your tenant.
#. Adjust case count and score count limits, if necessary.
#. Add customer keys (`ck`) if they are available (and update this query if customer keys are added).
#. Uncomment rows for the bad-values blocklist after it is enabled for your tenant.

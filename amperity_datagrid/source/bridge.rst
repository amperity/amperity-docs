Advantages of Amperity Bridge include:

**Fast setup**
   Connect Amperity to a lakehouse in minutes using sharing keys instead of integrations.

**Zero copy**
   Control access to shared tables without replicating data across platforms. Build pipelines faster and consolidate your brand's storage costs into a single location.

**Scalable processing**
   Enrich massive volumes of data quickly. Data is not moved or transformed from where it resides. Model customer data directly in the lakehouse or model it in Amperity.

**Live data**
   View customer data at rest in a lakehouse or in Amperity through a shared catalog. Explore and query data without waiting for refreshes or updates.

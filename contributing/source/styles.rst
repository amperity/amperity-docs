Capitalization
==================================================

.. style-guide-capitalization-start

Avoid unnecessary capitalization. Use sentence case, including in headers and topic titles. Only use capitalization for proper nouns and certain feature names, like Stitch.

For Amperity
--------------------------------------------------

.. style-guide-capitalization-amperity-start

Apply capitalization for the names of the following areas in Amperity:

* **Stitch**

  Stitch builds your tables. Review your tables to view stitched records.

* **Data Explorer**
* Amperity APIs, such as **Profile API** and **Streaming API**
* Page names in the user interface: **Sources**, **Stitch**, **Customer 360**, **Queries**, **Activations**, **Destinations**, **Workflows**, and **Settings**
* Segment editors: **Segment Editor** and **Query Editor**.

  Both have SQL and visual options. Use the visual **Segment Editor** to build audiences for campaigns and journeys. Use the SQL **Query Editor** to return data for orchestrations.

.. _style-guide-capitalization-external:

For external brands and products
--------------------------------------------------

.. style-guide-capitalization-external-start

When referring to external brands and products use each brand's capitalization and pattern preferences as much as possible.

These are often available from brand guidelines or from a copyright or trademark notice or from reviewing their own technical documentation.

For example:

* `"Amazon S3" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__ is the trademark name for "Amazon Simple Storage Service". Spell out "Amazon S3" and do not shorten it to "S3".

* `"Conversions API" <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/>`__ is the name Meta Ads Manager uses to describe the API for sending offline events to Meta Ads Manager.

  Spell out "Conversions API" and append "offline events" for context. Do not abbreviate "Conversions API" in documentation even if casual marketing conversations substitute "CAPI" for any offline events story.

  .. important:: Each destination may have its own specific terminology for offline events. For example, TikTok Ads Manager uses the "Events API for offline events".

Matching record pairs are included when they score better than this value. A lower value leads to more matches and weaker pairs. A higher value leads to fewer matches and more precise pairs. Five values may be chosen: 1.0 (weak), 2.0 (moderate), 3.0 (high, default and recommended value), 4.0 (excellent), and 5.0 (exact).

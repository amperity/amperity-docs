Amperity requires access to your Facebook Ads account. This access may expire or be removed periodically, depending on how OAuth is managed for your Facebook Ads account.

If Amperity is unable to send data to your Facebook Ads account ask an administrator to reauthorize access to your Facebook Ads account.

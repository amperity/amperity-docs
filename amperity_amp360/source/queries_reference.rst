.. _queries-tab:

Queries page
==================================================

.. queries-tab-start

The **Queries** page provides an overview of the status of every query. A table shows the status and details. Queries are listed by row. The details include the date and time at which this query last ran, along with the number of records (rows) that were returned during the last completed run.

Query editor
==================================================

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-sql-query-editor-start
   :end-before: .. term-sql-query-editor-end

.. queries-editor-start

Use the **Query Editor** to build SQL queries against tables and columns in your customer 360 database to support any downstream workflow. The **Query Editor** uses |sql_presto|.

   :width: 600 px
   :alt: Use the SQL Segment Editor on the Queries page.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. queries-editor-context-start

Queries may be authored using the visual **Query Editor** or the **SQL Query Editor**. Click **Create**, and then select the query editor to open. Queries that are already created have an icon that shows from which query editor they were authored.

* |fa-visual-segment| indicates the query was created using the visual **Query Editor**.
* |fa-sql-segment| indicates the query was created using the **SQL Query Editor**.

All queries must be activated before they can run as part of a scheduled workflow.

.. queries-editor-context-end

.. queries-editor-multiuser-warning-start

.. note:: Amperity is a multi-user system and the set of queries for your company is shared across all users. That means that if one user creates a draft query, another can open and edit it, so work can be easily passed between people on your team.

   However, it also means that if 2 users are editing the same thing at the same time, their changes will collide.  Amperity resolves this by applying the last set of changes saved as a whole. This will always keep the query in a consistent state (it will never be half-implemented). But changes that were saved first will be overwritten. As a result, we strongly recommend that you coordinate changes to specific objects in Amperity with others on your team.

.. queries-editor-multiuser-warning-end


.. _queries-editor-presto-sql:

About Presto SQL
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-presto-sql-start
   :end-before: .. term-presto-sql-end

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-start

Amperity queries are built using Presto SQL to define a **SELECT** statement. Please refer to the |sql_presto| reference.

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-end

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-select-statements-start

All queries that are built via the **SQL Query Editor** are done using a |sql_presto_select| statement. In some cases, a |sql_presto_with| is used along with the **SELECT** statement. Each select statement can additional functionality, such as |sql_presto_where|, |sql_presto_left_join|, |sql_presto_group_by|, |sql_presto_order_by|, |sql_presto_limit| clauses, |sql_presto_case| expressions, |sql_presto_functions|, |sql_presto_operators|, and other components that are part of Presto SQL, which is the underlying SQL engine for both the visual **Query Editor** and **SQL Query Editor**.

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-select-statements-end

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-tip-start

.. tip:: Follow the |sql_presto_recommendations| and patterns for  |sql_presto_indentation|, |sql_presto_naming_conventions|, |sql_presto_reserved_words|, and |sql_presto_whitespace|.

.. queries-editor-presto-sql-tip-end


.. _queries-build:

Build queries
==================================================

.. queries-manage-add-start

Queries may be authored using the visual **Query Editor** or the **SQL Query Editor**. Click **Create** and then select the query editor to open. Queries that are already created have an icon that shows from which query editor they were authored. All queries must be activated before they can run as part of a scheduled workflow.

.. queries-manage-add-end


.. _queries-add:

Add query
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-sql-query-editor-start
   :end-before: .. term-sql-query-editor-end

**To add a query using the SQL Query Editor**

.. queries-add-via-sql-editor-steps-start

#. From the **Queries** page click **Create**, and then select **SQL Query**. This opens the **SQL Query Editor**.
#. Under **Database**, select a database. The **Customer 360** database is selected by default.
#. Define the query against the selected database.
#. Click **Run Query** and debug any issues that may arise.
#. Click **Activate**.

.. queries-add-via-sql-editor-steps-end


.. _queries-preview-results:

Preview results
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-preview-results-start

You can preview the results of a SQL query by clicking the **Run Query** button. This will do one of the following things:

* Return the first 100 results of the query to the preview pane directly below the query editor.
* Return an empty table.
* Return some type of error.

Use the preview results pane to fine-tune your queries, to make sure they return the data you want, and to make sure they don't contain any errors.

.. queries-preview-results-end

.. queries-preview-results-tip-start

.. tip:: Query editor SQL queries often evaluate millions of records. This means they may take a few minutes to run. You may use other areas of Amperity while a query is being run.

   For draft queries, setting a the **LIMIT** clause to "100" while developing a query is often enough for testing and validating query results against very large data sets.

.. queries-preview-results-tip-end

**To preview query results**

.. queries-preview-results-steps-start

#. From the **Queries** page, open the menu for a query, and then select **View**. This opens a query editor.
#. Click **Run Query** to run the query. Wait for it to return results.
#. Example the columns and the data that is in them.
#. Adjust your query as necessary until it runs correctly.
#. Click **Activate**.

.. queries-preview-results-steps-end


.. _queries-editor-validate:

Validate query
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-editor-validate-start

SQL queries are validated from the **SQL Query Editor** by clicking the **Run Query** button. The results of the query are returned in the results window. The quality of the results can be inspected, and then fine-tuned. Errors in the syntax are reported in the results window.

.. queries-editor-validate-end


.. _queries-add-to-orchestration:

Add to orchestration
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-add-to-orchestration-start

Use the **Orchestration** option to define a schedule for a query.

.. queries-add-to-orchestration-end

**To add a query to an orchestration**

.. queries-add-to-orchestration-steps-start

#. From the **Queries** page, open the menu for a query, and then select **View**. This opens a query editor.

   .. tip:: The query does not need to be in edit mode to configure an orchestration.
#. Under **Being Sent To** click **Add one now**. This opens the **Add Orchestration** dialog box.
#. Follow the steps to add an orchestration. The steps will vary depending on the destination, the data template, and the orchestration.
#. Click **Save**.

.. queries-add-to-orchestration-steps-end

.. _queries-example-cohort-analysis:

Cohort analysis
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-example-cohort-analysis-start

The following SQL builds a cohort analysis against the **Transaction Attributes Extended** table that returns a month-by-month view of customers acquired, split by channel (store vs. online), and then for each monthly cohort, how many repurchased within 60, 90, 180, and 365 days, and the channel on which customers made their repeat purchases.

.. tip:: Build cohort analysis queries for your tenant, and then send the results downstream to :doc:`your favorite analytics and/or BI tool <sendto_analytics_bi>`.

.. _queries-example-days-to-second-purchase:

Days to second purchase
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-example-days-to-second-purchase-start

The following example shows how to return the days to second purchase starting from a date range for the first order.

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT
     days_to_second_purchase
     ,COUNT(DISTINCT amperity_id) AS "customer_count"

Leaky bucket ratio
--------------------------------------------------

.. queries-example-leaky-bucket-start

A leaky bucket ratio tracks the difference between the customers your brand wins and loses over time.

The following query shows how to build a leaky bucket ratio by using columns in the **Customer Attributes** and **Transaction Attributes Extended** tables to find the difference between lost and won customers during the past month and the past year.

.. note:: This example assumes that the **Churn Trigger Start Datetime** and **Churn Trigger** fields are enabled in the **Customer Attributes** table. Uncomment the following sections in the SQL for the **Customer Attributes** table:

   .. code-block:: sql

      /*
      ,churn_triggers_cte AS (
        SELECT

.. important:: 

   You must configure this query to match your brand's product catalog.

   The **product_description** field represents the name of a specific product in your product catalog. Update this field to match the field in your product catalog that defines product descriptions. For example, this may be a field that returns a SKU value. Update the "'<string>'" value to match the specific name of a product.

   The **product_group** field represents a category of products within your product catalog. Update this field to match the field in your product catalog that defines product categories.

   Use the "AND product_group <> '<group>'" line to specify one (or more) groups. Add a line for each group. Remove the line when product categories should not returned for your product replenishment use case.

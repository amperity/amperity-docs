.. _tools-for-marketers-common-workflows:

Common workflows
==================================================

.. tools-for-marketers-ampiq-common-workflows-start

Common marketing workflows use a combination of segment insights and predictive attributes to define audiences, and then assign those audiences to campaigns that are split into a series of control and treatment groups that allow you to test and refine that campaign over time.

* Use segment insights to build high-value segments.
* Use recommended audience sizes to find the right number of customers for your campaign.
* Perform opportunity sizing on a per-segment basis.
* Build segments by customer value. For example: "top 1%", "top 5%", or "top 10%".
* Use predicted modeling attributes to build campaigns based on future customer behavior, such as for predicted customer lifetime value (pCLV), churn propensity, and next best product.
* Review customer behavior by lifecycle status, such as "new", "active", "at risk", or "churned".

Sending campaigns
==================================================

.. tools-for-marketers-static-intro-start

Sending campaigns from Amperity is a combination of three things: segments, audiences, and destinations. The following series of topics describes how these work.

* A :doc:`segment <segments>` defines the audience that you use with your campaign.
* A :doc:`campaign <campaigns>` breaks that audience down into sub-audiences that align to your marketing strategies and goals.
* :doc:`Destinations <destinations>` are the locations and channels to which you sends those sub-audiences, after which you will perform specific marketing activities to support your marketing campaign.

Example use cases
==================================================

.. tools-for-marketers-example-use-cases-start

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use case
     - Description
   * - **Personalize campaign messaging**
     - Customers may be more responsive to personalized messaging. Connect with your high-value customers on a more personal level if current campaigns are showing low engagement.
   * - **Reactivate churning customers**
     - Use engagement data along with your churn prevention campaigns to escalate an offer to customers who are engaging with your brand and are predicted to be high-value.
   * - **Use different channels to engage customers**
     - An unengaged email user may be more responsive to other channels, such as social media or text messaging. Use engagement data and predicted customer lifetime value to identify high-value customers, and then test those results across channels.
   * - **Build cross-selling journeys**
     - Customers bring higher value when they purchase across categories. Combine audience sizes and customer rankings to personalize cross-selling journeys.
   * - **Identify messages with higher engagement**
     - Generate segment insights that identify when your high-value customers are more likely to engage with promotional messaging, clienteling outreach, or personalized recommendations.
   * - **Personalize the first-time buyer journey**
     - The second purchase can be a challenge for many brands. Identify your high-value customers with predicted customer lifetime value and see how they engage with your brand, and then personalize their first-time buyer experience.

About this topic collection
==================================================

.. tools-for-marketers-about-this-collection-start

The left-side navigation (from top to bottom) in this topic collection uses a verb-based approach to loosely organize around the series of actions that you may do when defining audiences, and then building campaigns that send audience lists to a variety of marketing channels.

The left-side navigation has sections for the following types of activities:

#. Understanding marketing use cases that are enabled by Amperity.
#. Understanding which predicted attributes are available to you as an output of predictive modeling.
#. Building segments using a visual segment editor. Use segment insights to identify high-value segments.
#. Building campaigns with combinations of control groups, treatment groups, subaudiences, and exclusion lists.
#. Sending treatment groups in your campaigns to a variety of marketing channels.

Example workflow
==================================================

.. tools-for-marketers-example-workflow-start

Amperity standard output tables provide the foundation for a complete view of your customer. Use segments to return any type of results, and then build campaigns to send those results to any marketing channel.

The numbers in the previous diagram represent a scenario that builds an audience, and then adds that audience to a campaign that is sent to a variety of marketing channels:

#. Open Amperity and review segments and segment insights.
#. Open the visual segment editor and build a high-value audience that meets the goals for an upcoming marketing campaign.
#. Add the audience to a campaign, and then define combinations of control groups, treatment groups, subaudiences, and exclusion lists. Associate each treatment group to one or more marketing channels.
#. Schedule the campaign, and then send a segment of your audience to each defined marketing channel.

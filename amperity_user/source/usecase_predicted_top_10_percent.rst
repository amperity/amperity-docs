When predictive modeling is enabled for your tenant you can use output from the |predicted customer lifetime value (CLV) model|, which helps you identify your highest value customers by value tier. Each tier represents a percentile grouping of customers by predicted value:

* Platinum represents the top 1%
* Gold represents customers who fall between 1% and 5%
* Silver represents customers who fall between 5% and 10%

Select all three of these predicted value tiers to build an audience that contains customers who are predicted to be in your top 10% (inclusive) high value customers.

     - The first step is to identify customers whose predicted customer lifetime value is platinum, gold, or silver. Choose the **Predicted Customer Lifetime Value Tier** attribute from the **Predicted CLV Attributes** table, select the "is in list" operator, and then select "Platinum", "Gold", *and* "Silver" from the list:

       Click the **Refresh** button located on the right side of the **Segment Editor** to view updated values for the combination of customers who have a predicted platinum, gold, or silver *and* a contactable email address.

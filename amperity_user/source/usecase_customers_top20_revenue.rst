Which customers are your top 20-percent for revenue during the previous year?

Use the monetary component of approximate RFM scores to find customers who are in the top 20-percent, along with the percentage of total revenue those customers represent.

.. tip:: Divide percentage of revenue by the number of customers in the top 20 to find the average percentage of revenue that is generated by each customer across all of your brands, stores, channels, and regions.

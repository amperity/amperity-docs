==================================================
Audience attributes
==================================================

.. attributes-overview-start

Audience attributes are available from a series of standard tables that are generated by Amperity based on your data sources and how you have applied semantic tags to that data.

Some audience attributes represent consolidated views of your customers, while others are based on predictive modeling and other calculations that are part of Amperity and provide a series of specific attributes that you can use to define high-value segments for use with downstream campaigns.

Predicted attributes
==================================================

.. attributes-predicted-start

The following types of predicted attributes are made availble by standard output:

* :ref:`Customer lifetime value <attributes-predicted-clv>`
* :ref:`Product affinity <attributes-predicted-affinity>`

.. attributes-predicted-end


.. _attributes-predicted-clv:

Customer lifetime value
--------------------------------------------------

.. attributes-predicted-clv-start

Customer lifetime value (CLV) attributes use historical customer behavior to predict customer lifetime value during the next calendar year, including by historical customer status and historical lifetime value tier.

The following attributes are available from the **Predicted CLV Attributes** table.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attributes
     - Description
   * - **Predicted Average Order Revenue Next 365 Days**

       #. Platinum: top 1% of customers
       #. Gold: top 1%-5% of customers
       #. Silver: top 5%-10% of customers

       #. Medium: top 25%-50% of customers
       #. Low: bottom 50% of customers

   * - **Predicted Order Frequency Next 365 Days**

.. _attributes-predicted-affinity:

Product affinity
--------------------------------------------------

.. attributes-predicted-affinity-start

Product affinity attributes associate your customers to recommended audience sizes and rankings by products. 

The following attributes are available from the **Predicted Affinity** table.

.. attributes-predicted-affinity-end

.. attributes-predicted-affinity-table-start

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attributes
     - Description
   * - **Audience size large**
     - A flag that indicates the recommended audience size. When this value is ``True`` the recommended audience size is large.

       A large audience is predicted to include ~90% of future purchasers, while also including a high number of non-purchasers.
   * - **Audience size medium**
     - A flag that indicates the recommended audience size. When this value is ``True`` the recommended audience size is medium.

       A medium audience is predicted to include ~70% of future purchasers, though it may also include a moderate number of non-purchasers.
   * - **Audience size small**
     - A flag that indicates the recommended audience size. When this value is ``True`` the recommended audience size is small.

       A small audience is predicted to incude ~50% of future purchasers, while including the fewest non-purchasers. Use a small audience size to help prevent wasted spend and reduce opt-outs.
   * - **Product attribute**
     - The field against which product affinity is measured. For example: a category, a class, or a brand.

   * - **Ranking**
     - A ranking of customers by their score for this product. A rank that is less than or equal to X provides the top N customers with an affinity for this product.

   * - **Score**
     - The strength of a customers's affinity for this product, shown as an uncalibrated probability.

       .. tip:: This score is used internally by Amperity and does not directly correlate to ranking or audience size. Sort results by **ranking**, and then compare to audience sizes. Higher rankings within smaller audience sizes correlate with stronger affinity.

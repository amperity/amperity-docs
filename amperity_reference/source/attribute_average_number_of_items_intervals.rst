.. attribute-average-items-start

Average number of items attributes identify the average order sizes (or "number of items purchased") during the specified time period. Average number of items attributes are available at the following intervals:

* L30D Average Num Items (30 days)
* L3M Average Num Items (3 months)
* L6M Average Num Items (6 months)
* L12M Average Num Items (12 months)
* LY12M Average Num Items (12-to-24 months)

Available operators
==================================================

.. attribute-average-items-conditions-start

The following table lists the operators that are available to these attributes.

.. note:: These attributes have a Decimal data type. All Decimal data types share the same set of operators. Recommended operators for this attribute are identified with "|attribute-recommended| **More useful**" and operators with more limited use cases are identified with "|attribute-stop| **Less useful**".

   * - Operator
     - Description
   * - **is**
     - Returns a specific average number of items, such as "4.20", "7", or "5.10".

       .. tip:: Use the following operators to return a range of averages instead of a specific average: **is between**, **is greater than**, **is greater than or equal to**, **is less than**, and **is less than or equal to**.

   * - **is between**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns a range of items that is between the specified averages.

   * - **is greater than**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average number of items that are greater than the specified average number of items.

   * - **is greater than or equal to**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average number of items that are greater than or equal to the specified average number of items.

   * - **is in list**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is in list** condition; individual average number of items are not typically made available in a list.

   * - **is less than**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average number of items that are less than the specified average number of items.

   * - **is less than or equal to**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average number of items that are less than or equal to the specified average number of items.

   * - **is not**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is not** condition.

       For example, if you specified "4.50" then any average number of items less than or equal to "4.49" and any average number of items greater than or equal to "4.51" would be returned.

   * - **is not between**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Discovers outlier discount amounts.

       For example, if most of your average number of items are between "2.10" and "3.20", use "2.10" and "3.20" to return averages that were less than and greater than those values.

   * - **is not in list**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is not in list** condition when individual profit amounts are not made available as a list.

   * - **is not NULL**
     - Returns customer records that have a value, such as "4.10", "10", and ".90", but also " " (a space) and "0" (zero). If the record has *any* value it will be returned.

   * - **is NULL**
     - Returns customer records that do not have a value.

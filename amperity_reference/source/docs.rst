.. _docs-cross-site-search:

Cross-site search
==================================================

.. docs-cross-site-search-start

Cross-site search enables a single interface that returns results for all topics in all topic collections.

Synonyms are applied to search results to associate commonly used search terms to the right topics. For example: "SFMC" is a synonym for "Salesforce Marketing Cloud" and a search for either will return the same result.

A naming pattern is used to help you recognize reference content and user-focused content within the search results:

* Topics in the **Amperity A-Z** collection start with "About", such as "About Couriers" or "About Semantic Tags".
* Topics in the **User Guides** and **Operators Guide** topic collections start with *verbs*, such as "Manage Databases", "Send Query Results", and "Build Campaigns".

.. docs-cross-site-search-end

.. docs-cross-site-search-responsive-start

On a tablet or mobile device, search is available from the |bars| menu in the top-right corner. Click that menu to open the navigation, and then the search box is located at the top of that menu.

.. docs-cross-site-search-responsive-end


.. _docs-left-side-navigation:

Left-side navigation
==================================================

.. docs-left-side-navigation-start

The left-side navigation represents all of the topics within a topic collection and is organized in a way that keeps similar topics close together, either by component or by workflow.

* **User Guides** describe marketer activities, such as building audiences (using segments and segment insights), and then configuring those audiences to be part of campaigns that support a variety of marketing channels, use cases, and outcomes and analytics, along with analytics activities like building queries, and then sending the results to downstream workflows and BI tools.
* **Operators Guide** describes how to configure Amperity to support your brand's use cases.
* **Amperity A-Z** is organized alphabetically.

.. docs-left-side-navigation-end

.. docs-left-side-navigation-responsive-start

On a tablet or mobile device, the left-side navigation is available from the |bars| menu in the top-right corner. Click that menu to open the navigation, and then browse through the sections.

.. docs-left-side-navigation-responsive-end


.. _docs-topic-pane:

Topic pane
==================================================

.. docs-topic-pane-start

The topic pane contains all of the content. The right-side navigation shows the structure of the topic. For example, a topic titled "About Couriers" contains all of the information about couriers and a topic titled "Send to Klaviyo" contains all of the information about sending query results to Klaviyo from Amperity.

Some topics are very long, like the Presto SQL and Spark SQL reference topics. All topics are complete based on the title of the topic. Use your browser's finder window to search within large topics for keywords as necessary.

.. docs-topic-pane-end


.. _docs-right-side-navigation:

Right-side navigation
==================================================

.. docs-right-side-navigation-start

The right-side navigation represents the sections within the current topic and is generated automatically based on the headers within the topic. For many topics only the title is represented within the left-side navigation.

.. docs-right-side-navigation-end

.. docs-right-side-navigation-responsive-start

On a tablet or mobile device, the right-side navigation is not available, though any anchor links will work correctly and will bring you to the right spot on the page.

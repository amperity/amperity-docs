Unified customer profiles are your brand's pathway to creating better interactions with your customers. Use tables from your customer 360 database to define collections of profiles, and then use those collections as the foundation for real-time interactions with your customers.

**Profiles page**

Use the **Profiles** page to manage profile collections.

* Create and manage profile collections
* Associate profile collections with event streams
* Define real-time segments, and then use them in journeys to activate individual customer profiles
* Use the Profile API to look up customer profiles for programmatic real-time workflows

**Event streams**

Use the `Streaming API <https://docs.amperity.com/operator/api_streaming.html>`__ to send events to Amperity, such as from your brand's website, email service provider, loyalty program, or SMS service provider. Make event streams available to profiles to build real-time use cases.

**Profile collections**

Each profile collection can define the following types of attributes:

* Known profile attributes from database tables, such as physical addresses, email addresses, customer names, phone numbers, and transaction history

* Aggregated events data. Use functions--average, count, count distinct, distinct, max, min, most frequent, and sum--for specific event types, conditions, and timeframes.

* Computed attributes using Spark SQL expressions.

**Always-on segments**

Build always-on segments, and then use them in journeys to build real-life customer experiences.

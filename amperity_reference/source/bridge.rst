Advantages of Amperity Bridge include:

* **Fast setup** Connect Amperity to a data lakehouse in minutes using sharing keys instead of integrations.

* **Zero copy** Control access to shared tables without replicating data across platforms. Build pipelines faster and consolidate your brand's storage costs into a single location.

* **Scalable processing** Enrich massive volumes of data quickly. Data is not moved or transformed from where it resides. Model customer data directly in the data lakehouse or model it in Amperity.

* **Live data** View customer data at rest in a data lakehouse or in Amperity through a shared catalog. Explore and query data without waiting for refreshes or updates.

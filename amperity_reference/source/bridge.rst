Advantages of Amperity Bridge include:

* **Fast setup** Connect Amperity to a lakehouse in minutes using sharing keys instead of integrations.

* **Zero copy** Control access to shared tables without replicating data across platforms. Build pipelines faster and consolidate your brand's storage costs into a single location.

* **Scalable processing** Enrich massive volumes of data quickly. Data is not moved or transformed from where it resides. Model customer data directly in the lakehouse or model it in Amperity.

* **Live data** View customer data at rest in a lakehouse or in Amperity through a shared catalog. Explore and query data without waiting for refreshes or updates.

Inbound prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------

.. bridge-inbound-share-prerequisites-start

Before you can create inbound sharing between Databricks and Amperity a recipient and share must be created in Databricks, after which tables are added to the share and access to the share is granted to the recipient.

The user who performs these actions may use the Databricks CLI or the Databricks Catalog Explorer and must be assigned the **CREATE RECIPIENT**, **CREATE SHARE**, **USE CATALOG**, **USE SCHEMA**, and **SELECT** permissions, along with the ability to grant the recipient access to the share.

.. _bridge-inbound-share-configure-databricks:

Configure Databricks
--------------------------------------------------

.. bridge-inbound-share-configure-databricks-start

To configure Databricks to share data with Amperity you will need to `CREATE SHARE <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html#create-share>`__ |ext_link| and add tables to that share, `CREATE RECIPIENT <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html#create-recipient>`__ |ext_link|, `grant the recipient access to the share <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-sharing/create-recipient.html#grant-the-recipient-access-to-a-share>`__ |ext_link|, and then get an `activation link <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-sharing/create-recipient.html#step-2-get-the-activation-link>`__ |ext_link|. The activation link allows a user to download a credential file that is required to :ref:`configure inbound sharing <bridge-inbound-share-add-bridge>` in Amperity.

.. note:: The following section briefly describes using the Databricks Catalog Explorer to configure Databricks to be ready to share data with Amperity, along with links to Databricks documentation for each step. You may use the Databricks CLI if you prefer. Instructions for using the Databricks CLI are available from the linked pages.

     - Connect the bridge to Databricks by uploading the credential file that was downloaded from the `activation link <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-sharing/create-recipient.html#step-2-get-the-activation-link>`__ |ext_link|. There are two ways to upload the credential file:

       #. Uploading the credentials as the second step when adding a bridge. Drop the file into the dialog box or browse to a location on your local machine.
       #. Choosing the **Upload credential** option from the **Actions** menu for an inbound share.

       After the credential file is uploaded, click **Continue**.

       .. important:: You can download the credential file only once. Recipients should treat the downloaded credential as a secret and must not share it outside of their organization.

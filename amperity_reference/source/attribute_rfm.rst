.. admonition:: What is an RFM score?

   An RFM score is an approximation that measures three data points:

   #. A :ref:`recency score (R) <attribute-rfm-recency>` that sorts customers by how recently they purchased during the previous 12 months.
   #. A :ref:`frequency score (F) <attribute-rfm-frequency>` that sorts customers by purchase frequency during the previous 12 months.
   #. A :ref:`monetary score (M) <attribute-rfm-monetary>` that score that sorts customers by spend amount during the previous 12 months.

   These individual scores can be combined into a single score (RFM).

.. attribute-rfm-start

Use approximate RFM (recency, frequency, monetary, and combined score) attributes to build segments that support many types of use cases.

Approximate RFM attributes include:

* :ref:`Attributes for recency, frequency, and monetary <attribute-rfm-individual>`, the three components of an RFM score
* :ref:`Score <attribute-rfm-score>`

.. _attribute-rfm-recency:

L12M Recency
--------------------------------------------------

.. attribute-rfm-recency-start

**L12M Recency** is a score that sorts customers by how recently they purchased during the previous 12 months.

.. attribute-rfm-recency-end

.. attribute-rfm-recency-find-start

To find customers who purchased most recently, start with the **L12M Recency** attribute, set its operator to **is**, and then specify a percentile. For example, use "10" to find customers who are in the top 10% for most recent purchases.

.. attribute-rfm-recency-find-end


.. _attribute-rfm-frequency:

L12M Frequency
--------------------------------------------------

.. attribute-rfm-frequency-start

**L12M Frequency** is a score that sorts customers by purchase frequency during the previous 12 months.

.. attribute-rfm-frequency-end

.. attribute-rfm-frequency-find-start

To find which customers purchased most frequently during the previous 12 months, start with the **L12M Frequency** attribute, set its operator to **is in list**, and then specify percentiles. For example, use "10" and "9" to find customers who are in the top 20% for purchase frequency.

.. attribute-rfm-frequency-find-end


.. _attribute-rfm-monetary:

L12M Monetary
--------------------------------------------------

.. attribute-rfm-monetary-start

**L12M Monetary** is a score that sorts customers by spend amount during the previous 12 months.

.. attribute-rfm-monetary-end

.. attribute-rfm-monetary-find-start

To find customers who spent the most money during the previous 12 months, start with the **L12M Monetary** attribute, set its condition to **is**, and then specify a percentile. For example, use "10" to find customers who are in the top 10% for spend amount.

.. attribute-rfm-monetary-find-end


.. _attribute-rfm-score:

Combined RFM scores
==================================================

.. attribute-rfm-score-start

The RFM score for the customer is based on transactions that occurred within the last 12 months. The RFM score is represented as an integer between "111" and "101010". This is a concatenated score that uses each of the individual recency, frequency, and monetary scores. The order is recency, then frequency, and then monetary.

For example, you can build an audience that contains your top 20% customers for recency, your top 30% customers for frequency, and your top 10% customers for monetary by setting the **L12M RFM Score** attribute to "9810" (or "9" for recency, "8" for frequency, and then "10" for monetary).

.. attribute-rfm-score-end

.. attribute-rfm-score-tip-start

.. note:: Unlike the individual RFM score attributes, the combined score for each attribute represents the lowest percentage group to include, and then includes all higher percentage groups. For example, if you set frequency to "8" it will return "8", "9", and "10", or your top 30%.

   This is different from the individual attributes where you could return your middle 30% by setting the **L12M Frequency** attribute to "5", "6", and "7".

You can access combined approximate RFM scores directly from the **Segment Editor**. To add this attribute to your segment, To add these attributes to your segment, click **Add condition** and then **Add attribute**. Select the **Transaction Attributes Extended** source, select the **L12M RFM Score** attribute, and then apply an condition.

How combined RFM scores work
--------------------------------------------------

.. attribute-rfm-score-howitworks-start

A combined RFM score returns a list of customers who meet the requirement for each individual RFM score: recency **and** frequency **and** monetary. An RFM score of "9810" represents three individual scores. The following diagram shows individual RFM scores for individual recency ("9"), frequency ("8"), and monetary ("10"). The darker color represents the  scores:

   :width: 600 px
   :alt: Each individual RFM score contributes to the combined RFM score.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

The combined score returns customers who met each requirement. This is often a much smaller list of customers than each individual RFM score and is not a percentile. The following diagram shows the overlap and the white section represents the much smaller list of customers who met each of the individual RFM scores.

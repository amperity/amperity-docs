.. model-predicted-clv-about-start

Amperity models predicted customer lifetime value (CLV) by comparing what customers spent in the previous year to their predicted spend in the coming year, and then predicts for each customer their:

#. Probability of purchase
#. Number of orders
#. Average order value

You can use predicted CLV modeling to build high-value audiences that identify:

* Which customers have the highest predicted value?
* Which customers will respond better to special offers and perks?
* What are the best personalized experiences for your top customers, such as personalized rewards, offers, and content?
* Which customers have individual price preferences?

Use cases
==================================================

.. model-predicted-clv-use-cases-start

The predicted CLV model helps you identify your highest value customers by year or by value tier:

#. :ref:`How much will customers spend in the next year? <model-predicted-clv-use-cases-spend>`
#. :ref:`Which customers are your most valuable customers? <model-predicted-clv-use-cases-most-valuable>`

How much will customers spend?
--------------------------------------------------

.. model-predicted-clv-use-cases-spend-start

The **Predicted CLV Next 365d** attribute in the **Predicted CLV Attributes** table contains the total predicted customer spend over the next 365 days.

After you select this attribute you can specify the type of values you want to use for this audience, such as:

* Predicted CLV is greater than $100
* Predicted CLV is less than $400
* Predicted CLV is between $100 and $400

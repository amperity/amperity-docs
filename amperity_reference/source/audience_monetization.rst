The **Audience monetization** feature allows you to package your first-party data in the form of customer audiences as a product to sell on third-party marketplaces.

This feature allows you to define audiences using existing segments or by creating a new segment with the **Visual Segment Editor**. Instead of sending these audiences to a marketing destination, like Facebook or Google Ads, you are sending them to a marketplace where advertisers can purchase access to them.

.. courier-groups-context-start

A courier group is typically configured to run automatically on a recurring schedule. All couriers within a courier group run as a unit; couriers with required files must complete before any downstream processes, such as Stitch or database generation, can be started.

For each courier with required files, Amperity determines if those files have updates, and then pulls updated files to Amperity. Depending on the run type, Amperity may then run Stitch and generate (or refresh) a customer 360 database. Orchestrations, recurring campaigns, and Profile API indexes may be configured to run as part of a courier group after the customer 360 database is refreshed.

.. courier-groups-what-a-courier-group-does-start

What a courier group does:

#. Logically organizes a list of couriers and bridges into a group that shares the same schedule and workflow.
#. Allows for each courier to be assigned schedule variance via wait times and offsets.
#. Enables both automatic and ad hoc runs.
#. Polls each data source associated with a courier in the group to determine if data is ready to be pulled to Amperity.
#. Pulls source data into Amperity.
#. Runs Stitch and generates a customer 360 database.
#. Runs downstream activations, which includes orchestrations, recurring campaigns, and refreshing Profile API endpoints.

What a courier group needs:

#. At least one courier or bridge.
#. A schedule.
#. A run type.
#. Configuration for courier wait times and offsets to help ensure that all couriers assigned to the courier group have a time window that is large enough to complete data collection.

.. _courier-groups-add:

Add a courier group
==================================================

.. courier-groups-add-start

Use the **Add courier group** button to add a courier group to Amperity. A courier group should be created to consolidate individual couriers into a scheduled courier group.

.. courier-groups-add-end

.. courier-groups-add-context-start

For each courier added to a courier group, define a wait time and the number of days to look for data. This is used to help determine how much time the courier group should wait for the files associated with a courier to be ready for processing.

In some cases, if the files are not ready, the courier (and courier group) will fail. But in other cases, if the files in the courier are not flagged as required, the courier group may continue processing the rest of the files.

       Use a cron string to define a schedule for the courier group.

       .. tip:: Daylight savings time can affect a schedule. Be sure to set the schedule to be stable and not require changes over time. For example: if a schedule is set to 12:30 AM, and then you fall back, the schedule may become 11:30 PM (fall back) or 1:30 AM (spring forward).

     - Define how the courier group will run: a **Full workflow**, a **Partial workflow**, or an **Ingest only** workflow.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockups-workflow-courier-group-run-types.png
          :width: 400 px
          :alt: A courier group has three run types.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       A full workflow refreshes domain tables, runs Stitch, refreshes your customer 360 database, and then runs every activation that is configured to run as part of this courier group workflow.

       A partial workflow refreshes domain tables, runs Stitch, refreshes your customer 360 database, but does not run any activations.

       An ingest-only workflow refreshes domain tables, but does not run Stitch.


   * - .. image:: ../../images/steps-06.png

          :alt: Step 6.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

     - To enable the courier group and have it run on the configured schedule, set the courier group to **Active**. (If this setting is set to **Inactive** the courier group will not run on a schedule, but may be run manually.)

       Many courier groups are scheduled to run on a daily basis. Some courier groups are scheduled to run less frequently, such as bi-weekly, monthly, or even quarterly. Use the **Only retrieve files dropped in the past day?** setting to configure a courier group that runs less frequently to only look for files dropped yesterday.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockups-workflow-courier-group-settings.png
          :width: 400 px
          :alt: Enable runtime alerts for workflows.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       .. tip:: A courier group that runs less frequently, such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly, will (by default) look for files on each day that has passed since the last time the courier group ran.

          When a courier group is configured to run less frequently, you can also configure that courier group to only look for files on a specific day.

          To use this approach, it is recommended to configure your upstream systems to make their files available to the courier group on a schedule that ensures they will be available to the courier group within a 24-hour window. This window is based on the schedule that is defined for the courier group.

          Configure the courier group to run at the end of that 24-hour window, and then enable the **Only retrieve files dropped in the past day?** option, which forces the courier group to only look for files that were made available within the previous 24 hours.

          :alt: Step 7.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

     - Add one (or more) couriers to the courier group.

       For each courier in the courier group, select a courier, configure the wait time and offset, and then enable alerts.

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       **About wait times**

       A wait time is a constraint placed on a courier group that defines an extended time window for data to be made available at the source location.

       .. important:: A wait time is not required for a bridge.

       A courier group typically runs on an automated schedule that expects customer data to be available at the source location within a defined time window. However, in some cases, the customer data may be delayed and isn't made available within that time window.

       Use a wait time to extend the time window for data to be made available. This can help reduce the number of alerts that may be generated for data sources that cannot be picked up by a courier group.

Courier group settings
==================================================

.. courier-groups-settings-start

A courier group can be configured for specific run types, schedules, time zones, and alerts.

.. courier-groups-settings-end


.. _courier-groups-setting-activate:

Activate courier group
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-setting-activate-start

A courier group :ref:`must be activated <courier-groups-howto-activate>` in order for it to run on an end-to-end schedule that pulls data to Amperity using couriers, syncs data using bridges, runs Stitch, refreshes databases, and then runs any orchestration, orchestration group, campaign, or profile API endpoint that is associated with the courier group.

A courier group that is :ref:`deactivated <courier-groups-howto-deactivate>` may be run manually.

.. courier-groups-setting-activate-end


.. _courier-groups-setting-alerts:

Courier group alerts
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-setting-alerts-start

Courier groups may be configured for the following types of alerts:

* :ref:`courier-groups-howto-notify-slow`

.. * :ref:`courier-groups-howto-notify-success`

.. courier-groups-setting-alerts-end


.. _courier-groups-setting-run-types:

Run types
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-run-types-start

A courier group can be configured with any of the following run types:

**Full workflow**
   A full workflow refreshes domain tables, runs Stitch, refreshes your customer 360 database, and then runs every activation that is configured to run as part of this courier group workflow.

**Partial workflow**
   A partial workflow refreshes domain tables, runs Stitch, refreshes your customer 360 database, but does not run any activations.

   .. important:: Use partial workflows in sandboxes to ensure that data in your sandbox is not inadvertently sent to downstream destinations.

**Ingest-only workflow**
   An ingest-only workflow refreshes domain tables, but does not run Stitch.

.. courier-groups-schedules-start

Amperity uses cron syntax to schedule the time at which a courier group is available for transferring files from a customer data source location to Amperity. A courier group that is scheduled runs automatically. Schedules are in UTC.

.. courier-groups-schedules-end

.. courier-groups-schedules-note-start

.. note:: Scheduling a courier group is optional. When a courier group is not assigned a schedule, it may be run manually on an ad hoc basis.

.. courier-groups-schedules-note-end

.. courier-groups-schedules-context-start

A courier group that is scheduled to run on a daily basis will check for files on a daily basis.

A courier group that runs less frequently, such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly, will (by default) look for files on each day that has passed since the last time the courier group ran.

When a courier group is configured to run less frequently, you can also configure that courier group to only look for files on a specific day.

To use this approach, it is recommended to configure your upstream systems to make their files available to the courier group on a schedule that ensures they will be available to the courier group within a 24-hour window. This window is based on the schedule that is defined for the courier group.

Configure the courier group to run at the end of that 24-hour window, and then enable the **Only retrieve files dropped in the past day?** option, which forces the courier group to only look for files that were made available within the previous 24 hours.

.. courier-groups-schedules-context-end

.. courier-groups-schedules-tip-start

.. tip:: Daylight savings time can affect a schedule. Be sure to set the schedule to be stable and not require changes over time. For example: if a schedule is set to 12:30 AM, and then you fall back, the schedule may become 11:30 PM (fall back) or 1:30 AM (spring forward).

.. courier-groups-schedules-tip-end


.. _courier-groups-setting-time-zones:

Time zones
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-timezones-start

A courier group schedule is associated with a time zone. The time zone determines the point at which a courier group's scheduled start time begins. A time zone should be aligned with the time zone of system from which the data is being pulled.

Use the **Use this time zone for file date ranges** checkbox to use the selected time zone to look for files. If unchecked, the courier group will use the current time in UTC to look for files to pick up.

.. courier-groups-timezones-end

.. courier-groups-timezones-about-start

The time zones that are available for selection in Amperity are modeled after the Google Calendar and are similar to:

.. code-block:: none

   (GMT-08:00) Pacific Time
   (GMT-07:00) Mountain Time
   (GMT-08:00) Central Time
   (GMT-09:00) Eastern Time

.. courier-groups-timezones-about-end

.. courier-groups-timezones-downstream-start

The time zone that is chosen for an courier group schedule should consider every downstream business processes that requires the data and also the time zone(s) in which the consumers of that data will operate.

.. courier-groups-timezones-downstream-end

.. courier-groups-timezones-tip-start

.. tip:: Do not create courier group schedules that may occur during a daylight savings time transition.

   For example, an courier group schedule with the cron string of ``30 2 * * *`` and the time zone of "(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time" will run once a day most at 2:30am, except for one day in the spring when it will not run at all and one day in the fall when it will run twice.

   This is because American daylight savings time transitions at 2:00 AM, meaning the 2:00 AM hour occurs twice when transitioning out of daylight savings time (Fall) and is skipped altogether when transitioning into daylight savings time (Spring).

.. courier-groups-timezones-tip-end


.. _courier-groups-sources:

Add sources
==================================================

.. courier-groups-sources-start

The following data sources may be configured to run as part of a courier group workflow:

* :ref:`courier-groups-source-bridge-syncs`
* :ref:`courier-groups-source-couriers`

.. courier-groups-sources-end


.. _courier-groups-source-bridge-syncs:

Bridge syncs
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-bridge-syncs-start

Amperity Bridge enables data sharing between Amperity and data lakehouses. Each bridge can be :ref:`quickly configured <courier-groups-howto-add-bridge>` for inbound and outbound shares to give your brand access to shared tables without replication.

.. courier-groups-bridge-syncs-end

.. courier-groups-couriers-end


.. _courier-groups-source-courier-alerts:

Courier alerts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. courier-groups-source-courier-alerts-start

Files can be missing for any number of reasons, including by delays that may have occurred in upstream workflows that exist outside of Amperity. And in many situations a file is late, not missing.

.. courier-groups-source-courier-alerts-end

.. courier-groups-source-courier-alert-types-start

Individual couriers within a courier group may be configured for the following types of file-specific alerts:

* :ref:`courier-groups-howto-add-courier-alert`
* :ref:`courier-groups-howto-add-courier-stop`

.. courier-groups-source-courier-alert-types-end


.. _courier-groups-source-courier-days:

Number of days
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. courier-groups-schedule-offset-start

A courier can be configured to look for files within range of time that is older than the scheduled time. The scheduled time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), unless the "Use this time zone for file date ranges" checkbox is enabled for the courier group.

This range is typically 24 hours, but may be configured for longer ranges. For example, it's possible for a data file to be generated with a correct file name and datestamp appended to it, but for that datestamp to represent the previous day because of how an upstream workflow is configured. A wait time helps ensure that the data at the source location is recognized correctly by the courier.

.. warning:: This range of time may affect couriers in a courier group whether or not they run on a schedule. A manually run courier group may not take its schedule into consideration when determining the date range; only the provided input day(s) to load data from are used as inputs.

.. courier-groups-schedule-offset-end

.. courier-groups-schedule-offset-callout-start

.. important:: The schedule defines the frequency at which the courier group will run.

   The timezone is the time at which the courier group will run. This may be set to your local time zone.

   Individual courier wait times are calculated using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), even when a non-UTC time zone is specified for the courier group. This means that when a courier group runs, the current time in UTC is used to calculate the wait time.

   When a courier group is set to your local time zone, you must consider the offset for your local time zone when defining the wait time for each courier in the courier group.

.. courier-groups-schedule-offset-callout-end


.. _courier-groups-source-courier-wait-times:

Wait times
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-start

A wait time is a constraint placed on a courier group that defines an extended time window for data to be made available at the source location.

.. important:: A wait time is not required for a bridge.

A courier group typically runs on an automated schedule that expects customer data to be available at the source location within a defined time window. However, in some cases, the customer data may be delayed and isn't made available within that time window.

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-end

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-window-start

Use a wait time to extend the time window for data to be made available. This can help reduce the number of alerts that may be generated for data sources that cannot be picked up by a courier group.

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-window-end

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-note-start

.. note:: For couriers associated with a filedrop location the default wait time is 0. A polling operation only checks for a data source before declaring success or failure. For couriers associated with REST APIs and data warehouses, the polling operation is always considered to be successful.

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-note-end

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-downstream-start

A downstream process begins after each load operation is completed for each data source associated with each courier in the courier group and each domain table has been updated.

.. courier-groups-schedule-wait-time-downstream-end


.. _courier-groups-review-activations:

Review activations
==================================================

.. courier-groups-review-activations-start

An activation represents a part of a workflow that is run after databases have been updated. Any number of activations may be assigned to a workflow, after which all activations are run automatically on the schedule that is defined by the workflow.

Individual :ref:`queries <courier-groups-howto-add-query>` and :ref:`data exports <courier-groups-howto-add-data-export>`, :ref:`orchestration group <courier-groups-howto-add-orchestration-group>` (that group multiple queries into a single activation), :ref:`Profile API endpoints <courier-groups-howto-add-profile-api-endpoint>`, and :ref:`recurring campaign <courier-groups-howto-add-recurring-campaign>` may all be assigned to a workflow as an activation.

.. _courier-groups-howto-pull-for-24-hours:

Pull files for previous 24 hours?
--------------------------------------------------

.. courier-groups-howto-pull-for-24-hours-start

A courier group that runs less frequently, such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly, will (by default) look for files on each day that has passed since the last time the courier group ran.

When a courier group is configured to run less frequently, you can also configure that courier group to only look for files on a specific day.

To use this approach, it is recommended to configure your upstream systems to make their files available to the courier group on a schedule that ensures they will be available to the courier group within a 24-hour window. This window is based on the schedule that is defined for the courier group.

Configure the courier group to run at the end of that 24-hour window, and then enable the **Only retrieve files dropped in the past day?** option, which forces the courier group to only look for files that were made available within the previous 24 hours.

.. courier-groups-howto-pull-for-24-hours-end

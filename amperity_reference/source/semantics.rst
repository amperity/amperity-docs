How semantic tags work
==================================================

.. semantics-howitworks-start

Semantic tags must be defined for every feed that will provide profile data to Stitch. This ensures that data from rich sources of profile data are brought into Amperity in a consistent manner, which improves the outcome of the Stitch process.

Semantic tagging works like this:

#. A field in the customer's system named "fname" stores an individual's given name.
#. A field in the customer's system named "lname" stores the same individual's last name.
#. A field in the customer's system named "primary-phone" stores a phone number.
#. A field in the customer's system named "date" stores an individual's birthdate.
#. And so on.

For those semantic tags, the feed should apply semantic tags like this:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input field
     - Semantic tag
   * - fname
     - given-name
   * - lname
     - surname
   * - primary-phone
     - phone
   * - date
     - birthdate
   * - ...
     - ...

This same pattern is applied to every customer data source that is brought into Amperity and it results in every single semantically-tagged field being analyzed by Amperity during the Stitch process in exactly the same way.

Amperity has built-in semantic tags for personally-identifiable information (PII), transactions, and behaviors. In addition, custom semantic tagging may be applied to fields when adding them can help identify unique individuals across massive data sets.

Profile semantic tags are used by Amperity for identity resolution, which is the process that builds a unified customer profile for all of your unique customers. All other semantic tags, such as for transactions and itemized transactions, are used to associate your customer's interactions with your brand to their individual customer profiles.

.. semantics-howitworks-end

.. semantics-howitworks-profile-tags-start

.. admonition:: What semantic tags does Stitch rely on?

   Stitch relies on the following semantic tags to be applied to customer records:

   * **given-name** (first name) and **surname** (last name). In some cases, a **full-name** is inferred (if not available).
   * Other important profile details, such as **birthdate**, **email**, and **phone**.
   * The **address**, **address2**, **city**, **state**, and **postal** tags are combined to represent a complete physical address.
   * Other location details, such as **country** and **company**.
   * Additional profile details, when available, such as **gender**, **generational-suffix** (Jr., Sr., III, etc.), and **title**.

   Stitch uses foreign keys to associate individual customers to their interactions with your brands.

.. _semantics-compliance:

Compliance
==================================================

.. semantics-compliance-about-start

The following table describes the semantic tags that are used for CCPA and/or GDPR compliance workflows. Compliance semantics are prefixed with **compliance/** in the semantics drop-down menu in the **Feed Editor**.

.. semantics-compliance-about-end

.. semantics-compliance-request-table-start

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description

   * - **id**
     - **Required**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-id**

       A unique identifier for an inbound request.

       This identifier is used for validation purposes, allowing compliance actions to be easily linked to specific requests.


   * - **type**
     - **Required**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-type**

       The request type for the compliance action. May be one of:

       **dsar**
          Default. Generate a report without deleting data.

       **delete**
          Delete rows that are found by the request strategy.

       **delete_pii**
          Delete only personally identifiable information (PII) from rows that are found by the request strategy.

        .. important:: The delete_pii request type will only delete columns that are tagged with the **compliance/pii** semantic tag.


   * - **strategy**
     - **Required**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-strategy**

       The request strategy for the compliance action. May be one of:

       **exact**
          Default. Find all rows that exactly match the compliance request.

       **connected_pii**
          Find all rows that exactly match the compliance request *along with* any row in a stitched table that shares an Amperity ID with those records.


   * - **email**
     - **Optional**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-email**

       Find all records that match an email address. This action is case-insensitive.

       The values in this field will be checked against any source table that has the **email** semantic tag.


   * - **phone**
     - **Optional**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-phone**

       Find all records that match a phone number.

       The values in this field will be checked against any source table that has the **phone** semantic tag.


   * - **address**
     - **Optional**

       Semantic tags:
        * **compliance/request-address**
        * **compliance/request-address2**
        * **compliance/request-city**
        * **compliance/request-state**
        * **compliance/request-postal**
        * **compliance/request-country**

       The values in these fields will be checked against any source table that has the **address**, **address2**, **city**, **state**, **postal**, and/or **country** semantic tags. If a source table only has some of these values tagged, the missing values will be treated as **NULL**. 

        .. note:: An address group contains multiple fields, but is a single entity for a compliance action. In order to match to records in source tables, ALL values must match. Address standardization should be applied upstream of Amperity so that address can be reliably used to identify source records.

   * - **custom-key**
     - **Optional**

       Semantic tag: **compliance/request-custom-key**

       Find all records that match a custom value. This action is case-insensitive.

       The values in this field will be checked against any source table that has the **compliance/custom-key** semantic tag.

.. semantics-compliance-request-table-end

.. semantics-compliance-table-pii-note-start

.. note:: Source keys and linkage tables identify which source table records were used to create a custom domain table record. They do not trace individual fields, so **compliance/pii** semantic tags should be applied directly to the source tables, not on the custom domain tables, if the **delete_pii** compliance type is used.

.. semantics-compliance-table-pii-note-end


.. _semantics-custom:

Custom
==================================================

.. semantics-custom-start

A custom semantic is a string that is applied as a semantic tag when configuring a feed. Some use cases for custom semantics include specifying keys (primary, customer, and foreign), assigning ordinals or namespaces to email and phone PII semantics, or arbitrary strings to capture specific customer use cases.

.. semantics-custom-end

.. semantics-custom-table-about-start

The following table describes recommended patterns to use when defining custom semantics:

.. semantics-custom-table-about-end

.. semantics-custom-table-start

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 400
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Custom Semantic Pattern
     - Description
   * - **itemized transactions**
     - All custom semantics that are associated with itemized transactions must be prefixed with **txn-item/**.
   * - **keys**
     - Keys are used to identify signals in source data that can be applied during the Stitch process.

   * - **loyalty-id**
     - .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-loyalty-id-start
          :end-before: .. term-loyalty-id-end

       A loyalty ID may be associated with a customer key (**ck**) or a foreign key (**fk-[namespace]**), but otherwise follows all patterns associated with PII semantics.

       .. tip:: Use additional custom semantic tags when the data contains more information about loyalty programs. Keep the prefix **loyalty-**, and then append an appropriate string to improve the user experience with downstream workflows. For example, if the data contains a field for loyalty points, use a custom semantic named **loyalty-points** to tag that field.

   * - **PII**
     - All custom semantics that are associated with transactions should be prefixed with the PII semantic to which the custom semantic is most closely associated. For example: **email-personal** and **email-work** are most closely associated with the **email** semantic.

       .. note:: In general, the use of custom semantics for PII is limited to namespace or ordinal variation of **email** and **phone**.
   * - **product**
     - All custom semantics that are associated with products must be prefixed with **pc/**.

.. _semantics-db:

Database

   :start-after: .. databases-database-howto-set-validation-rules-warning-start
   :end-before: .. databases-database-howto-set-validation-rules-warning-end

.. semantics-db-table-about-start

The following semantics may be used to tag fields as required, as unique, or as both required *and* unique in database tables:

.. semantics-db-table-about-end

.. semantics-db-table-start

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 15 55
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Semantic name
     - Datatype
     - Description
   * - **required**
     - 
     - Indicates if the field is required to have a non-NULL value.

       .. note:: This tag is assigned automatically to all fields that contain the Amperity ID.

       A field that is assigned the **required** semantic requires every value for that field within the same table to have a non-NULL value, but does not require values to be unique. NULL values will cause an error during validation. All other values, including zero-length strings, will pass validation.

       .. note::

          A field may be assigned the **db/required** *and* **db/unique** semantics. Use this only for fields that must be present *and* unique, such as for the Amperity ID.

   * - **unique**
     - 
     - Indicates if the field is required to be a unique field in the customer 360 database.

       A field that is assigned the **unique** semantic requires every value for that field within the same table to be unique. Fields with NULL values are ignored by validation, but all other values, including zero-length strings, must pass.

       .. note::

          A field may be assigned the **db/required** *and* **db/unique** semantics. Use this only for fields that must be present *and* unique, such as for the Amperity ID.

.. semantics-db-table-end


.. _semantics-email:

Email engagement
==================================================

.. semantics-email-start

Email engagement semantic tags capture email events data, such as clicks, opens, bounces, opt-ins, opt-outs, and conversions from any email service provider (ESP) data source.

#. Use :ref:`email events <semantics-email-event>` semantic tags when raw email events data is sent directly to Amperity.

   .. caution:: The data volume for email events data can be very large. Talk with your Amperity representative before applying email events semantic tags to raw email events data.

#. Use :ref:`email summary <semantics-email-summary>` semantic tags when data is aggregated prior to sending it to Amperity.

.. semantics-email-end

.. semantics-email-events-end

.. semantics-email-events-important-start

.. important:: Email events semantic tags should only be applied to data sources that provide at least 15 months of raw email events data. The storage requirements for this type of data can be significant. Talk with your Amperity representative about your downstream use cases prior to applying email events semantic tags to raw email events data sources.

.. _semantics-keys:

Keys
==================================================

.. semantics-keys-start

Keys are used to identify signals in source data that can be applied during the Stitch process. For example, a table that contains customer records automatically assigns the **pk** semantic to any field identified as a primary key. For tables that contain interaction records, a foreign key is often used to associate important fields for interaction records to primary keys for customer records. This allows interaction records to be correlated with the Amperity ID as an outcome of the Stitch process even though interaction records are (typically) not processed by Stitch for the purpose of identity resolution.

You can define custom blocking labels using **bk-[label]**, and then use them as a blocking strategy for Stitch.

.. tip:: What happens to customer keys in the **Unified Coalesced** table?

   * Records may have NULL customer keys.
   * There may be only one customer key per data source.
   * There may be multiple customer keys per Amperity ID. This is because customer keys may also be tagged as foreign keys.

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-fk-start
   :end-before: .. term-fk-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-start

A foreign key semantic tag may be applied to any column in any data source, but should be associated with a field that can also act as a primary key for that data source *and* is present in other tables.

A foreign key may be used once within a table. A table may have more than one foreign key. For example, if a data source contains customer and audience identifiers, apply **fk-customer** to the customer identifier and **fk-audience** to the audience identifier.

.. semantics-key-foreign-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-default-start

Amperity is configured by default to prioritize foreign key matching over separation key unmatching.

.. semantics-key-foreign-default-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-common-start

The most common use cases for foreign keys associate fields that act like primary keys within interaction records to the primary keys within customer records, such as:

* A customer identifier for transactions and itemized transactions associated to the primary key in a loyalty table.
* A strong identifier within clickstream data to the primary key in a customer profile table.

Use foreign keys to define meaningful connections across all types of data sources to enable deterministic matching of record pairs during pairwise comparison.

.. semantics-key-foreign-common-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-tip-start

.. tip:: What happens to foreign keys in the **Unified Coalesced** table?

   * Records may have NULL foreign keys.
   * There may be multiple foreign keys in the data source, but there may not be duplicate foreign keys.
   * There may be multiple foreign keys per Amperity ID.
   * There should not be multiple Amperity IDs per foreign key.

.. semantics-key-foreign-tip-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-trivial-duplicates-start

.. note:: If foreign keys are linked together by a trivial duplicate they will appear in the **Unified Preprocessed Raw** table as a comma-separated list.

.. semantics-key-foreign-trivial-duplicates-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-important-start

.. important:: A foreign key may also be tagged as a separation key. A foreign key applies when two records have the same value for the key. A separation key applies when two records have different values for the key.

Tagging the same field as both foreign and separation keys can be useful when customer data has a strong identifier that is also associated with an important profile semantic tag, such as **phone** or **email**.

.. semantics-key-foreign-important-end

.. semantics-key-foreign-hide-pii-start

.. tip:: In an unusual case where a foreign key is associated with a field to which :ref:`a profile (PII) semantic tag is applied <semantics-profile>` be sure to configure the column created by the foreign key in customer 360 database tables to :ref:`hide values from users without permission to view PII <policies-option-restrict-pii>`.

Primary keys (pk)
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-primary-key-start
   :end-before: .. term-primary-key-end

.. semantics-key-primary-caution-start

.. caution:: Amperity allows you to assign the **pk** semantic tag to more than one field in the **Feed Editor**. This is because with some data sources, such as data that contains events -- clickstream, email, web activity, mobile app activity, and so on -- often contain many fields that could be used like a primary key.

   A domain table can have only one primary key. When the **pk** semantic tag is applied to more than one field in the **Feed Editor**, those values are concatenated into a primary key, which is stored in the **_pk** field in the domain table. You should limit the number of fields to which the **pk** semantic tag is applied.

.. semantics-key-primary-caution--end

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst

   :end-before: .. term-pk-end

.. semantics-key-primary-tip-start

.. tip:: What happens to primary keys in the **Unified Coalesced** table?

   * Each record in the **Unified Coalesced** table must have a primary key.
   * A primary key is unique within a data source, but that primary key may not be unique across all data sources.
   * There can be only one primary key per data source; each record in the **Unified Coalesced** table can be uniquely identified by the pair of values defined in the "datasource" and "pk" columns.
   * Each record in the Unified Coalesced table may only be associated with a single Amperity ID.

.. semantics-key-primary-tip-end


.. _semantics-key-separation:

Separation keys (sk)
--------------------------------------------------

.. semantics-key-separation-non-default-start

Amperity is configured by default to prioritize foreign key matching over separation key unmatching. Prioritizing separation key unmatching can help prevent address overclustering problems for groups of records with similar names and similar households.

.. semantics-key-separation-non-default-end

.. semantics-key-separation-warning-start

.. note:: To use separation keys you must configure the classifier for Stitch model selection to be set to ``:general-ordinal-sk-priority``.

.. semantics-key-separation-warning-end

.. semantics-key-separation-start

Use a separation key (sk) for deterministic unmatching of records. This prevents Stitch from matching certain types of records during pairwise comparison, which is a step in the Stitch process that scores all of the possible connections between all records in a group of records.

.. semantics-key-separation-end

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-sk-start
   :end-before: .. term-sk-end

.. semantics-key-separation-assign-pairs-start

A record pair is assigned a no conflict score (0.0) when separation keys contain conflicting values during pairwise comparison. A record pair is split into two clusters when both pairs contain a non-NULL value.

.. note:: The following separation keys do not consider approximately matched values to be conflicting values:

   * **sk-given-name**  For example, Mike and Michael are not conflicting values.
   * **sk-birthdate**  For example, 1981-09-08 and 1981-08-09 are not conflicting values.
   * **sk-generational-suffix**

.. semantics-key-separation-assign-pairs-end

.. semantics-key-separation-important-start

.. tip:: A separation key may also be tagged as a foreign key. Tagging the same field as a foreign and separation key can be useful when customer data has a strong identifier that is also associated with an important profile semantic tag, such as **phone** or **email**.

.. _semantics-loyalty:

Loyalty programs
==================================================

.. semantics-loyalty-start

Loyalty programs help brands increase customer loyalty and provide incentives for customers to opt-in to email and SMS communication.

Adding this data to Amperity can help your brand understand the value of your loyalty program and run more effective campaigns based on how your customers interact with your loyalty program and your brand.

Amperity provides the following groups of semantic tags for use with loyalty programs:

* :ref:`Loyalty events <semantics-loyalty-events>`
* :ref:`Loyalty profiles <semantics-loyalty-profiles>`

.. semantics-loyalty-end


.. _semantics-loyalty-events:

Loyalty events
--------------------------------------------------

.. semantics-loyalty-events-start

Apply loyalty events semantic tags to data sources that contain data that captures customer interactions with your brand's loyalty program. Loyalty events semantics are prefixed with **loy-event/** in the semantics drop-down menu in the **Feed Editor**.

.. semantics-loyalty-events-end

.. semantics-loyalty-events-make-available-to-stitch-start

.. note:: Loyalty events are unique by Amperity ID and event datetime when:

   #. The **fk-loyalty-id** semantic tag is applied to the same source field as the **loy-event/loyalty-id** field.
   #. The **loy-event/email** semantic tag is applied to fields that contain email addresses.

   * - **[custom-semantic]**
     - String
     - |checkmark-required| **Required**

       Use a foreign key (recommended) *or* a custom semantic tag (such as ``customer-id``) within interaction records to associate them to the Amperity ID.

       .. important:: See **fk-[namespace]**. At least one field must have the **[custom-semantic]** or **fk-[namespace]** semantic tags applied to it to support downstream processing requirements for interaction records. You may apply more than one, or use a combination, of these semantic tags.

       When a custom semantic tag is added to itemized transactions data it:

       * Must be a unique customer identifier that can be used to join interaction records (transactions and itemized transactions) to tables that contain the Amperity ID.
       * Must be unique for each order ID in the **Unified Itemized Transactions** table.

       A namespaced foreign key must be present in interaction records that contain transactions data. A foreign key may used along with a customer ID.

       .. important:: See **[custom-semantic]**. At least one field must have the **fk-[namespace]** or **[custom-semantic]** semantic tags applied to it to support downstream processing requirements for interaction records.

       When a foreign key is added to transactions data it:

       * Must match a foreign key in a table that is output by Stitch.
       * Must be well-distributed across the data source (a high percentage of values must not be 0).
       * Must be unique for each order ID in the **Unified Itemized Transactions** table.

   * - **Product catalogs**
     - String
     - *Optional*

       Product catalog semantics may be applied to data sources that contain product catalog data. There are two sets of product catalog semantic tags: **txn-item/** and **pc/**.

       #. You may use **txn-item/** product catalog semantic tags when product catalog data appears within data sources that contain details about your product catalog when it exists alongside details about orders and items.

          Fields to which **txn-item/** product catalog semantic tags are applied will be built into the **Unified Itemized Transactions** table in your customer 360 database.

       #. You may use **pc/** product catalog semantic tags in any data source that contains details about your product catalog. Fields to which the **pc/** product catalog semantic tags are applied will be built into the **Unified Product Catalog** table.

       .. important:: The names of the semantic tags that are available for product catalogs are identical. For example: "product-brand", "product-category", and "product-gender". The difference is the prefix that you choose to use and the pattern your tenant chooses for defining your product catalog within Amperity. You should determine which pattern you want to use early in your configuration and deployment process. Talk with your Amperity representative if you have questions about the best ways to approach this within your tenant.

       To review the descriptions for all of the product catalog semantic tags you may prefix with **txn-item/** refer to the section in this topic about product catalog semantic tags.

   * - **product-id**
     - String
     - |checkmark-required| **Required**

       .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-product-id-start

       .. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
          :start-after: .. term-sku-start
          :end-before: .. term-sku-end

       For example, a shirt with the same color and material, but with three different sizes would be represented by three unique SKUs and would also be represented by three unique product IDs.

       For data that contains itemized transactions, where a single transaction includes more than one of the same product, the product ID must appear only once per order ID in the **Unified Itemized Transactions** table. Multiple instances of the same product must be added to the item quantity in the same row.

       .. caution:: Every customer has their own definition for SKUs and product IDs. Be sure to understand this definition before applying semantic tags to fields with product IDs to ensure they accurately reflect the customer's definition.

   * - **purchase-brand**
     - String
     - |checkmark-required| **Required**

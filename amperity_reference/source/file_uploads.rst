File uploads

.. file-uploads-overview-start

File upload use cases
==================================================

.. file-uploads-use-cases-start

You can use the CSV file upload feature to upload a CSV file to a database. The following examples shows several ways you can use this feature:

* Upload an anonymous list of customers which the system then connects with known customers with Amperity IDs
* Upload a reference file to render on the **Queries** page
* Upload a list of customers who filled out a survey in order to include in a campaign that addresses their concerns

.. file-uploads-use-cases-end


.. _file-uploads-example-sql:

SQL use case example
--------------------------------------------------

.. file-uploads-example-sql-start

Upload a list of customers to include or exclude from a campaign by building a query against file uploads that return the Amperity ID via the file upload feature.

The following example shows SQL in the **Query Editor** that returns a series of values from an uploaded file, joins those values to the **Merged Customers** table (using the **email** column in both tables), and then returns a list of Amperity IDs.

.. note:: This is not required for uploaded files that contain an **email** column. For more complex use cases, a query that is made available to segments and campaigns must return a list of Amperity IDs.

   WITH file_upload AS (
      SELECT
        email
        ,first_name
        ,last_name
      FROM uploaded_file_csv
    ),

    WITH get_amperity_id AS (
      SELECT
        amperity_id
        ,file_upload.email
      FROM Merged_Customers mc
      LEFT JOIN file_upload ON file_upload.email=mc.email
    )

    SELECT
      amperity_id
    FROM get_amperity_id

.. file-uploads-example-sql-end


.. _file-uploads-example-request:

Example inbound request
--------------------------------------------------

.. file-uploads-example-request-start

The following example shows a inbound request for a customer list in the form of a CSV file:

.. code-block:: none

   customer,email
   John Doe,john.doe@abc.com
   Jane Doe,jane.doe@abc.com
   John Smith,john.smith@abc.com
   Jane Smith,jane.smith@abc.com
   Jim Johns,jim.jones@abc.com

.. file-uploads-example-request-end


.. _file-uploads-query-output:
 
Query output
==================================================

.. file-uploads-query-output-start

The following are some ways that you can use this feature on the **Segments Editor** and on the **Campaigns** page: 

* Create a complex view of customers on the **Segments** page by adding a query output to a segment, which can also be included or excluded in a campaign on the **Campaigns** page.
* Create a custom join logic from an uploaded customer list for further segmentation in the **Segment Editor** and on the **Campaigns** page.

   .. note:: Queries that are made available for segments and campaigns can reference any uploaded files within the database that they are associated with.

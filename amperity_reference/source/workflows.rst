About the Workflows page
==================================================

.. workflows-page-start

The workflows page contains two tabs: **Run history** and **Configured**. **Run history** allows you to see a filterable list of workflow runs that have happened. **Configured** allows you to see at a glace all of the automatically-run workflows that have been configured. For each workflow you can view details for every step within a workflow. Both tabs in the **Workflows** page automatically refresh with the latest status of any workflows that are currently running.

.. image:: ../../images/mockups-workflow-success.png

   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Within **Run history**, click the name of any workflow run to open a page that shows a list of tasks and the order in which they occurred in the workflow run.
Within **Configured**, click the name of any workflow to open up its configuration.

.. workflows-page-end

.. workflow-policy-start

.. note:: The **Workflows** page is accessible to users of Amperity who are assigned the **Amp360 User** policy, the **AmpIQ User** policy, the **DataGrid Operator** policy, *or* the **DataGrid Administrator** policy in your production tenant and the **DataGrid Administrator** policy in a sandbox.

   The **Workflows** page is read-only for users who are assigned the **AmpIQ User** policy.

.. workflow-policy-end


.. _workflows-discover-alerts:

Workflow alerts
==================================================

.. workflows-discover-alerts-start

A workflow alert is sent when a task within the workflow requires your attention. Each alert contains a description of what caused the alert, along with a link to the workflow in Amperity. Workflow alerts can be configured to send when workflows fail, workflows succeed, workflows exceed a configured runtime threshold, query results exceed a configured threshold, and when workflows are manually stopped.

Workflow alerts can be grouped into automated workflow alerts and workflow run alerts. Configure recipients for automated workflow alerts when you want to monitor recurring automated workflow runs. Subscribe to individual workflow run alerts when you want to subscribe to updates for individual manually-run workflows, or if you want to subscribe to updates for a specific workflow run.

Workflow alerts may be configured to be :ref:`sent to an email address <workflows-howto-open-from-email-alerts>` or sent to :ref:`a channel in a Slack workspace <workflows-howto-open-from-slack-alerts>`. Click the link in the email or Slack message to open the workflow in Amperity, and then resolve the issue(s) that caused the workflow alert.

.. workflows-discover-alerts-end

Automated workflow alerts
--------------------------------------------------

.. automated-workflow-alerts-start

Configure automated workflow alerts by workflow type within the **Automated workflow alerts** dialog in the workflow page. Use this as your default set of recipients to receive alerts for regularly occurring workflows.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of automated workflow alerts by workflow type:

Courier groups
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. courier-group-automated-alert-details-start

Alerts are sent when:

* Files are missing
* A failure occurs within any part of a courier group workflow, including courier groups with orchestration groups, campaigns, or profile API indexes configured to run as part of the workflow
* The courier group succeeds, if configured. If downstream workflows are configured, an alert will be sent both when database generation is complete and when downstream workflows succeed
* The courier group runtime exceeds a threshold, if configured
* Query thresholds are reached, if configured
* A user cancels an automatically launched workflow

.. courier-group-automated-alert-details-end

Orchestration groups
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. orchestration-group-automated-alert-details-start

Alerts are sent when:

* A failure occurs within an orchestration group workflow, regardless of whether the orchestration group is configured to run after a courier group or run on a schedule.
* A failure occurs in an upstream courier group if your orchestration group is configured to run after a courier group. This is to let you know about potential delays to your orchestration group workflow.
* A user cancels an automatically launched workflow
* The orchestration group succeeds, if configured. This is only available for orchestration groups run on a schedule. Subscribe to courier group runtime alerts if your orchestration group is configured to run after a courier group and you want to know when it succeeds.

.. orchestration-group-automated-alert-details-end

Campaigns
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. campaign-automated-alert-details-start

Alerts are sent when:

* A failure occurs within campaign send, regardless of whether the campaign is configured to run after a courier group or run on a schedule
* A user cancels an automatically launched workflow
* A failure occurs in an upstream courier group if your campaign is configured to run after a courier group. This is to let you know about potential delays to your campaign send.
* The campaign succeeds, if configured. This is only available for campaigns run on a schedule. Subscribe to courier group success alerts if your campaign is configured to run after a courier group and you want to know when it succeeds.
* The campaign runtime exceeds a threshold, if configured. This is only available for campaigns run on a schedule. Subscribe to courier group runtime alerts if your campaign is configured to run after a courier group and you want to know when it runs long.


.. campaign-automated-alert-details-end

.. automated-workflow-alerts-end

Workflow run alerts
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflow-run-alerts-start

Subscribe to alerts for individual workflow runs to receive alerts on manually run workflows, as well as receive alerts on specific workflow runs. Workflow run alerts are independent of automated workfow alerts. Recipients will receive the following alerts:

* Failure alerts
* Success alerts (always)
* Runtime alerts, if configured
* Query alerts, if configured
* Workflow stopped alerts

.. workflow-run-alerts-end


.. _workflows-discover-details:

Workflow run details
==================================================

.. workflows-discover-details-start

The workflow run details page provides a set of high-level details for a particular workflow run, along with a list of tasks that were run. To open the workflow run details page, click any workflow run in the list of workflows on the **Run history** tab or click the **last run** link in the **Config** tab.

High-level details are visible within a series of boxes along the top of the page and include:

* The workflow run's status, such as "succeeded", "failed", or "stopped"
* The type of workflow run, such as "courier", "courier group", "campaign send", "database", "file upload", and "orchestration group"
* Who started the workflow run, such as "automated" or a user name
* The time at which the workflow run started
* The runtime of the workflow run (from start to finish or from start to failure)

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-details-and-tasks.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: details.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Tasks appear in the lower part of the workflow run page. Tasks represent the individual steps a workflow followed while running.

.. admonition:: Workflow status icons

   The workflow details page uses the following icons to show workflow status.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 30 70
      :header-rows: 0

      * - |workflow-running|
        - Running

      * - |workflow-succeeded|
        - Succeeded

      * - |workflow-failed|
        - Failed

      * - |workflow-issue|
        - Issue

      * - |workflow-skipped|
        - Skipped


Tasks are grouped into stages, with each stage running a series of tasks. Individual stages are often aligned to pages within Amperity, such as **Sources**, **Stitch**, or **Customer 360**, but may also be aligned to components, such as the **Profile API** or predictive modeling.

Each stage contains a series of individual tasks that run in sequence.

For example, tasks for the **Sources** stage must locate today's data updates, pull those updates to Amperity, and then refresh domain tables with the updated data. Each data source that is located will show as an individual task, each data set that is pulled to Amperity will show as an individual task. Many of the steps a courier takes will show as an individual task.

.. tip:: Use the **View task details** menu option to learn more about the information that was submitted to each task, such as the name of a service, the ID for the file(s) that were submitted to the task, dependencies (such as list names or attribute names that are required by a destination), and so on.

   Outputs show the information that was submitted to the next step in the workflow.

   Inputs and outputs for an individual task within a workflow are unique to that workflow.

   Use the **Hide skipped tasks** option to hide all tasks within a workflow that were skipped. A skipped workflow is shown in the workflow details page with the |workflow-skipped| icon.

   Use the **Hide warnings** to hide warning banners that may appear in the top of the workflow details page. A warning describes a warning that was detected during the workflow, but did not prevent the workflow from completing. Most warnings should be investigated to determine their origin.

.. workflows-discover-details-end


.. _workflows-discover-details-actions:

Details page actions
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-start

All workflow runs can be inspected from the workflow details page, regardless of their status or whether there is a warning or an error. Any workflow that is running may be stopped.

.. tip:: You may configure Amperity to send workflow alerts to an email address or to a channel in a Slack workspace. Individual team members who have access to workflow alerts can click a link to open the workflow in Amperity, after which they can investigate, and then take steps to resolve these warnings and errors.

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-end


.. _workflows-discover-details-actions-stop:

Stop workflow runs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-stop-start

You can stop a workflow that is actively running from one of the following locations:

#. The **Stop workflow** button in the top right of the workflow details page.
#. The **Stop workflow** option available from the actions menu on the **Run history** tab while that workflow is running.

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-stop-alt.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: stop workflow.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

When a workflow run is stopped while a task is running, the workflow will initially enter a “Stopping” state while the task is being stopped, after which the workflow will move to a “Stopped” state.

When a workflow run is stopped while no tasks are running it will immediately move to a “Stopped” state.

.. important:: Orchestration tasks that have started running within a workflow cannot be stopped because of external dependencies that an orchestration has with a downstream system. Orchestration tasks that have started may run to completion even when the workflow to which they are associated is stopped.

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-stop-end


.. _workflows-discover-details-actions-warnings:

Review warnings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-warnings-start

A workflow run may show an warning when Amperity detects a problem. For example:

* When a threshold that is defined for a validation report is exceeded
* Optional files are missing
* An issue with an upstream or downstream application, such as the amount of time it may take to send an audience to Google Ads (which is "up to 48 hours"; a new Google Ads workflow cannot start until a previous workflow has finished)

A warning does not typically prevent a workflow run from completing, but a warning should be investigated to determine its cause and, where possible, steps should be taken to fix it.

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-issues.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: review warnings.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Use the workflow details page to identify issues with workflow runs. Review the individual tasks that show warnings, and then work to resolve the underlying issue.

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-warnings-end


.. _workflows-discover-details-actions-errors:

Review errors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-errors-start

Some workflow runs may have errors that will prevent the run from completing successfully. Use the workflow details page to resolve workflows that failed by reviewing options for resolution, and then choosing one of those options or choosing to restart the workflow.

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-failures.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: review failures.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. tip:: Many workflow failures are caused by errors are directly actionable using a workflow resolution. In some situations, viewing the full error message can help troubleshoot the root cause of an error.

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-errors-end


.. _workflows-discover-details-actions-failures:

Resolve failures
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-failures-start

A workflow alert is sent when warnings are detected or when an individual task has failed.

You can access workflow alerts from the following locations:

* The **Workflows** page. Click a workflow to open the workflow details page for that workflow.

  .. note:: Individual tasks with warnings are shown with the |workflow-issue| icon. Individual tasks with failures are shown with a status of "failed" and the |workflow-failed| icon.

* Email alerts that were sent to an email address
* A Slack channel that is configured to receive alerts
* A notification within the **Recent activity** pane on the **Sources**, **Stitch**, **Customer 360**, **Queries**, and **Destinations** pages.
* The **Activity log** within the **Settings** tab will list an entry for every alert sent

When you receive a workflow alert, use the link provided within the workflow alert to open Amperity, and then review the workflow details page. The individual task that contains the error that caused the workflow to stop is shown with the the |workflow-failed| icon. An error message will appear at the top of the workflow details page.

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-resolve-error-message.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: review the error.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Click the **Show resolutions** buttom within the error message to start the process of resolving the error. This opens the **Resolve failed workflow** dialog box.

.. image:: ../../images/howitworks-workflows-resolve-show-resolutions.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: How workflows work: review the error.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

The **Resolve failed workflow** dialog box contains a list of resolution options that are specific to the stage within which the error occurred and the task at which the workflow failed.

Select one of the resolution options, and then click the **Continue** button to step through the workflow resolution.

.. workflows-discover-details-actions-failures-end


.. _workflows-common:

Common resolutions
==================================================

.. workflows-common-start

The following types of workflow resolutions are the ones you are most likely to see in your tenant:

* :ref:`Ignore missing file <workflows-common-ignore-missing-files>`
* :ref:`Restart workflow <workflows-common-restart>`
* :ref:`Retry task <workflows-common-retry>`
* :ref:`Skip a task <workflows-common-skip-task>`
* :ref:`Update credentials <workflows-common-update-credentials>`
* :ref:`Update error threshold <workflows-common-update-error-threshold>`

.. workflows-common-end


.. _workflows-common-ignore-missing-files:

Ignore missing file
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-ignore-missing-files-start

A workflow resolution may allow temporarily ignoring missing files for any courier or courier group.

.. workflows-common-ignore-missing-files-end


.. _workflows-common-restart:

Restart workflow
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-restart-start

A workflow resolution may allow restarting a workflow. This will rerun the workflow starting from the task that failed using the current state of your tenant, including any configuration updates that have been made.

.. workflows-common-restart-end

.. workflows-common-restart-note-start

.. caution:: A workflow resolution may allow you to restart a workflow after making a configuration update to your tenant.

   For example, a workflow restart may allow:

   * Updating credentials
   * Updating a query

   In these types of cases, the resolution *allows the state of your tenant to be updated* before retrying the task. This change will be applied to all future workflows.

.. workflows-common-restart-note-end


.. _workflows-common-retry:

Retry task
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-retry-start

A workflow resolution may allow retrying a specific task in a workflow. This is useful for transient issues that should not persist from one workflow to the next.

This type of resolution will rerun the workflow from the point at which the workflow failed, starting with the same failed task and using the same inputs as those provided to the failed workflow. In many cases, this type of resolution will allow to you temporarily change the state of your tenant to help troubleshoot the cause of the workflow.

.. workflows-common-retry-end

.. workflows-common-retry-caution-start

.. caution:: A workflow resolution may allow you to change a parameter, and then retry a task.

   For example, a workflow retry may allow:

   * Re-running Stitch with an empty table to troubleshoot the source of the workflow alert
   * Changing an input to determine if the missing input is the source of the workflow alert
   * Adjusting an error threshold

   In these types of cases, the resolution *does not change the state of your tenant* after retrying the workflow. It only changes the state of the active workflow.

   You will need to update your production tenant to persist the change to support future workflows.

.. workflows-common-retry-caution-end


.. _workflows-common-skip-task:

Skip a task
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-skip-feed-start

A workflow resolution may allow skipping a task. This is useful with:

* Missing or empty tables
* Required tables or fields are empty
* Schema changes
* Corrupted archives or malformed files
* PGP errors
* Connection errors

When a task is skipped a workflow will continue. You can work to resolve the cause of the skipped task asynchronously.

.. workflows-common-skip-feed-end


.. _workflows-common-update-credentials:

Update credentials
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-update-credentials-start

A workflow resolution may require updated credentials.

.. note:: When you configure Amperity to pull data from or send data to an upstream or downstream system, valid credentials must be provided during that configuration process.

   Credentials change over time. Keys get rotated, passwords get refreshed. Credential changes are often planned in advance, but always happen outside of Amperity and may have happened in-between yesterday's successful workflow and today's failed workflow.

When you see a workflow resolution that requires updated credentials, verify the credentials in the upstream or downstream system, and then update Amperity for those valid credentials. Once updated you should be able to restart the workflow.

.. workflows-common-update-credentials-end

**To update credentials**

.. workflows-common-update-credentials-steps-start

#. Open the **Credentials** page.
#. Review the details for the credentials used with this workflow. Update the credentials for TikTok Ads Manager if required.
#. Return to the workflow action, and then click **Resolve** to retry this workflow.

.. workflows-common-update-credentials-steps-end


.. _workflows-common-update-error-threshold:

Update error threshold
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-common-update-error-threshold-start

A workflow resolution may allow a temporary change to the error threshold that caused this workflow to fail so that this workflow may continue.

.. workflows-common-update-error-threshold-end


.. _workflows-context:

Context-specific resolutions
==================================================

.. workflows-context-start

Many workflows have context-specific resolutions that depend on upstream and downstream tasks within the workflow, but also may depend on steps that occur upstream or downstream from Amperity. It is impossible to predict the exact workflow steps that may be shown for any particular workflow action. In addition to :ref:`the most common workflow resolutions <workflows-common>`, and depending on the workflow, you may see any of the following context-specific workflow actions:

.. grid:: 2
   :gutter: 3
   :padding: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: Campaigns
      :link: workflows-context-campaigns
      :link-type: ref
      :shadow: sm

   .. grid-item-card:: Courier groups
      :link: workflows-context-courier-groups

   .. grid-item-card:: Stitch
      :link: workflows-context-stitch
      :link-type: ref
      :shadow: sm

.. workflows-context-end

.. workflows-context-note-start

.. note:: The potential list of context-specific workflow actions is larger than the lists of campaign-, courier group-, destination-, scheduled orchestration group- and/or source-specific resolutions described in this section. And this list of potential context-specific workflow actions may be only partially relevant to your tenant.

   For example, if your brand only uses Amazon S3 for file-based transfers, then SFTP-specific errors won't ever be shown. If your brand sends paid media campaigns to TikTok Ads and Meta Ads Manager, but not Google Ads, then Google Ads-specific errors won't ever be shown.

   This section is a reference meant to show that Amperity provides a broad (but thorough) list of workflow actions that address the most likely causes and solutions to help your brand self-service resolutions of issues as they may arise.

.. workflows-context-note-end


.. _workflows-context-campaigns:

Campaigns
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-context-campaigns-start

Some common workflow actions that your brand may see when sending campaigns from Amperity include:

* :ref:`Mismatched data type <workflows-campaigns-mismatched-datatype>`
* :ref:`Missing table <workflows-campaigns-missing-table>`
* :ref:`Unresolved column name <workflows-campaigns-unresolved-column-name>`
* :ref:`Workflow alerts <workflows-campaigns-alerts>`

.. workflows-context-campaigns-end


.. _workflows-campaigns-mismatched-datatype:

Mismatched datatype
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-campaigns-mismatched-datatype-start

A datatype defines what the value of an attribute can be. For example, an email address is a String, an order date is a Datetime, revenue is a Decimal, the number of items in an order is an Integer, and something that can be true or false is a Boolean.

It's possible for datatypes to be mismatched, which occurs when a campaign expects a datatype to be a String, but is returned as a Decimal (or some other non-String datatype). If a mismatched datatype occurs the campaign will fail, you will receive an error message, and an alert will be sent.

To resolve this error, open the link in the alert and visit the workflow actions page. The alert and workflow actions page will both contain the error message, which will be similar to:

::

   SYNTAX_ERROR: '=' cannot be applied to varchar, integer

Follow the steps in the workflow action to identify which table is causing the error and then either update the campaign to select attributes from a different table or work with your DataGrid Operator to fix the table.

.. workflows-campaigns-mismatched-datatype-end


.. _workflows-campaigns-missing-table:

Missing table
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-campaigns-missing-table-start

Amperity must be able to find the table from which campaign attributes will be pulled before sending them to your destinations. If a table is renamed or removed the campaign will fail, you will receive an error message, and an email will be sent.

To resolve this error, open the link in the alert and visit the workflow actions page. The alert and workflow actions page will both contain the error message, which will be similar to:

::

   Cannot select data from missing tables: <table name>

Follow the steps in the workflow action to identify which table is causing the error and then either update the campaign to select attributes from a different table or work with your DataGrid Operator to fix the table.

.. workflows-campaigns-missing-table-end


.. _workflows-campaigns-unresolved-column-name:

Unresolved column name
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-campaigns-unresolved-column-name-start

Amperity must be able to find the column from which campaign attributes will be pulled before sending them to your destinations. If a column is renamed or removed the campaign will fail, you will receive an error message, and an alert will be sent.

To resolve this error, open the link in the alert and visit the workflow actions page. The alert and workflow actions page will both contain the error message, which will be similar to:

::

   SYNTAX_ERROR: Column <column name> cannot be resolved

or:

::

   COLUMN_NOT_FOUND: Column '<column name>' cannot be resolved

Follow the steps in the workflow action to identify which column is causing the error, and then work with your DataGrid Operator to fix the column name that cannot be resolved.

.. workflows-campaigns-unresolved-column-name-end


.. _workflows-campaigns-alerts:

Campaign workflow alerts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-campaigns-alerts-start

You can configure recipients for campaign workflow alerts by adding :ref:`email addresses <workflows-howto-email>` or :ref:`Slack channels <workflows-howto-slack>` to the **Configure alerts** dialog box on the **Workflows** page.

.. workflows-campaigns-alerts-end


.. _workflows-context-courier-groups:

Courier groups
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-context-courier-groups-start

Some common workflow actions that your brand may see when pulling data to Amperity using courier groups include:

* :ref:`Runtime alerts <workflows-courier-groups-duration-alerts>`
* :ref:`Workflow alerts <workflows-courier-groups-alerts>`

.. workflows-context-courier-groups-end


.. _workflows-courier-groups-duration-alerts:

Runtime alerts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. courier-groups-configure-duration-alert-start

A runtime alert notifies when a courier group has run for longer than a configured amount of time. A runtime alert is sent to each email address that is configured to receive email alerts for courier groups and/or to a channel in your Slack workspace.

.. courier-groups-configure-duration-alert-end

**To configure a runtime alert for a courier group**

.. courier-groups-configure-duration-alert-steps-start

#. From the **Sources** page, open the menu for a courier group, and then select **Edit**.
#. Enable the **Warn if runtime exceeds** checkbox, and then set the number of hours (or minutes) at which, when this amount of time is exceeded, a workflow alert will be sent.
#. Click **Save**.

.. courier-groups-configure-duration-alert-steps-end


.. _workflows-courier-groups-alerts:

Courier group workflow alerts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-courier-groups-alerts-start

You can configure recipients for courier group workflow alerts by adding :ref:`email addresses <workflows-howto-email>` or :ref:`Slack channels <workflows-howto-slack>` to the **Configure alerts** dialog box on the **Workflows** page.

.. workflows-courier-groups-alerts-end


.. _workflows-context-databases:

Databases
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-context-databases-start

Some common workflow actions that your brand may see when generating databases include:

* Errors resolving column names in tables
* Missing tables
* SQL query alerts (including warning *and* failure thresholds)

.. workflows-context-databases-end


.. _workflows-context-destinations:

Destinations

#. :ref:`Authorize your Slack workspace <workflows-howto-slack-authorize>`
#. :ref:`Configure one (or more) Slack channels for workflow alerts <workflows-howto-slack-channels>`

.. workflows-howto-slack-end


.. _workflows-howto-slack-authorize:

Authorize workspace
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-start

You must authorize Amperity to be able to send workflow alerts to your Slack workspace. This authorization occurs within Slack.

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-end

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-important-start

.. important:: Only one Slack workspace may be authorized for your tenant.

   Amperity :ref:`only sends workflow alerts to the configured channels <workflows-howto-slack-channels>`. Amperity does not send direct messages ("@").

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-important-end

**To authorize a Slack workspace**

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-steps-start

#. From the **Users & Activity** page, under **Slack integration** click **Connect Slack workspace**.
#. This opens a Slack authorization page with a message similar to:

   ::

      Amperity is requesting permission to access the [your-brand's-workspace] Slack workspace.

   Click **Allow** to enable sending workflow alerts to your brand's Slack workspace. You can :ref:`configure specific channels <workflows-howto-slack-channels>` after you have authorized the Slack workspace.

#. Click **Save**.

.. workflows-howto-slack-authorize-steps-end


.. _workflows-howto-slack-channels:

Configure channels
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-howto-slack-channels-start

You can configure each workflow alert type to send alerts to one (or more) channels in your brand's Slack workspace. You may configure more than one channel to receive alerts for the same workflow type. You cannot configure workflow alerts to be sent as a direct message in Slack to a single individual.

.. tip:: Create a dedicated channel (or set of channels) in your brand's Slack workspace to which workflow alerts are sent. Channels to which workflow alerts are sent may be public or private.

   For most use cases, a single "#amperity-workflow-alerts" channel is sufficient, but some use cases may prefer to have dedicated channels for courier groups and campaigns.

.. workflows-howto-slack-channels-end

**To configure one (or more) Slack channels**

.. workflows-howto-slack-channels-steps-start

#. From the **Workflows** page, click **Automated workflow alerts**.
#. In the **Configure alerts** dialog box, under **Campaigns**, **Courier groups**, and **Scheduled orchestration groups**, add the name of the Slack channel to which you want to send workflow alerts, and then hit the RETURN button on your keyboard.

   You may enter more than one Slack channel for each workflow alert type and each workflow alert type may be configured for their own Slack channels.
#. Click **Save**.

.. important:: Include the octothorpe ("#") prefix for the Slack channel you want to send alerts to.


.. workflows-howto-slack-channels-steps-end


.. _workflows-howto-slack-disconnect:

Disconnect workspace
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. workflows-howto-slack-disconnect-start

You can disconnect a Slack workspace from the **Users & Activity** page. Select the |fa-kebab| menu icon for the configured workspace, select **Disconnect**, and then confirm that you want to disconnect the workspace.

.. workflows-howto-slack-disconnect-end


.. _workflows-howto-stop:

Stop a workflow
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-howto-stop-start

You can stop a workflow that is actively running from one of the following locations:

#. The **Stop workflow** button in the top right of an individual workflow's details page.
#. The **Stop workflow** option available from the |fa-kebab| menu on the **Workflows** page.

When a workflow is stopped while a task is running, it will initially enter a "Stopping" state while the task is being stopped, after which the workflow will move to a "Stopped" state. If a workflow is stopped while no tasks are running it will immediately move to a "Stopped" state.

A workflow alert is sent to all users who are subscribed to workflow alerts.

.. important:: Orchestration tasks that have started running within a workflow cannot be stopped because of external dependencies that each orchestration has with a downstream system. Orchestration tasks that have started may run to completion even when the workflow to which they are associated is stopped.

.. workflows-howto-stop-end


.. _workflows-howto-view-all:

View all workflows
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflow-policy-start

The **Workflows** page is available to users of Amperity who are assigned the **Amp360 User** policy or the **DataGrid Operator** policy. The **Workflows** page is not available to users who are only assigned the **AmpIQ User** policy.

.. workflow-policy-end


.. _workflows-howto-view-error-details:

View error details
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-howto-view-error-details-start

You can view error details for a workflow. Open an individual workflow, then from a row with an error or an issue, select the |fa-kebab| menu icon, and then choose **View error details**. This opens a dialog box that contains the full error message.

.. note:: Errors are often more directly actionable using a workflow resolution. In some situations, viewing the full error message can help troubleshoot the root cause of an error.

.. workflows-howto-view-error-details-end


.. _workflows-howto-view-inputs-and-outputs:

View inputs and outputs
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-howto-view-inputs-and-outputs-start

You can view the inputs and outputs for a workflow. Inputs show all of the information that was submitted to a task, such as the names of the service, the ID for the file(s) that were submitted to the task, downstream dependencies (such as list names or attribute names that are required by a destination), and so on. The inputs and outputs for an individual task within a workflow are unique to that workflow.

To view inputs and outputs for a workflow. Open an individual workflow, then from a row within the workflow, select the |fa-kebab| menu icon, and then choose **View inputs/outputs**. This opens a dialog box that contains all of the inputs and outputs for that task.

.. workflows-howto-view-inputs-and-outputs-end


.. _workflows-howto-view-details:

View workflow details
--------------------------------------------------

.. workflows-howto-view-details-start

Workflow details are available from the **Workflows** page. Click the name of the workflow *or* from the |fa-kebab| menu icon for workflow click **View details**.

Details include the list of individual tasks that occurred during the workflow, the workflow's current status, type of workflow, who started the workflow, the time at which the workflow started, and the runtime of the workflow (from start to finish).

* The :ref:`Recent activity pane <workflows-howto-open-from-recent-activity>` in the **Sources**, **Stitch**, **Customer 360**, and **Destinations** pages
* From the list of workflows on the :ref:`Workflows page <workflows-howto-open-from-workflow-page>`
* :ref:`An email address or alias <workflows-howto-open-from-email-alerts>` that is configured to receive workflow alerts sent from Amperity
* :ref:`A channel in your brand's Slack workspace <workflows-howto-open-from-slack-alerts>`

.. workflows-howto-view-resolutions-end

**To view workflow resolutions**

.. workflows-howto-view-resolutions-steps-start

#. Open the workflow from the recent activity pane, list of workflows, email, or Slack message.

   This will open Amperity. You may be required to log in.
#. On the individual workflow's page, when workflow resolutions are available, an alert is shown with a button named **Show resolutions**.

   This opens the **Resolve error** dialog for the workflow.

   A list of options is available for any failed workflow.

Available operators
==================================================

.. attribute-price-average-item-intervals-conditions-start

The following table lists the operators that are available to these attributes.

.. note:: These attributes have a Decimal data type. All Decimal data types share the same set of operators. Recommended operators for this attribute are identified with "|attribute-recommended| **More useful**" and operators with more limited use cases are identified with "|attribute-stop| **Less useful**".

   * - Operator
     - Description
   * - **is**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Returns a specific average item price, such as "9.99", "49.99", or "52.74".

       .. tip:: Use the following operators to return a range of average item prices instead of a specific average item price: **is between**, **is greater than**, **is greater than or equal to**, **is less than**, and **is less than or equal to**.

   * - **is between**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns a range of average item prices that are between the specified average item prices.

   * - **is greater than**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average item prices that are greater than the specified average item price.

   * - **is greater than or equal to**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average item prices that are greater than or equal to the specified average item price.

   * - **is in list**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is in list** condition; individual average item price amounts are not typically made available in a list.

   * - **is less than**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average item prices that are less than the specified average item price.

   * - **is less than or equal to**
     - |attribute-recommended| **More useful**

       Returns average item prices that are less than or equal to the specified average item price.

   * - **is not**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is not** condition.

       For example, if you specified "10.25" then any average item price less than or equal to "10.24" and any average item price greater than or equal to "10.26" would be returned.

   * - **is not between**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Discovers outlier prices.

       For example, if most of your average item prices are between "19.99" and "99.99", use "19.99" and "99.99" to return average item prices that were less than and greater than those values.

   * - **is not in list**
     - |attribute-stop| **Less useful**

       Avoid using the **is not in list** condition when individual price amounts are not made available as a list.

   * - **is not NULL**
     - Returns customer records that have a value, such as "4.99", "1.25", and "99.99", but also " " (a space) and "0" (zero). If the record has *any* value it is returned.

   * - **is NULL**
     - Returns customer records that do not have a value.

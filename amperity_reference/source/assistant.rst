.. assistant-usecases-start

Use the AI Assistant to:

* Ask for help while resolving a SQL error
* Get advice on how to improve a query
* Ask questions about SQL syntax, such as "What is the syntax for a window function?"
* Create SQL queries starting from natural language, such as "Who are my top 100 customers by lifetime spend?" or "Show me everyone who shopped in-store over the last 30 days."

.. _assistant-howitworks:

How the AI Assistant works
==================================================

.. assistant-howitworks-start

The AI Assistant is powered by a private instance of OpenAI GPT-4.

Amperity uses the largest context window that is currently available, and then provides query, schema, results, and error information to the model to help ensure the best chance of generating highly relevant results.

.. note:: More detail about how the AI Assistant works, including data sharing policies, how the model stores data, and what types of data is sent (or not sent), is available from the |ext_amperity_assistant_privacy_faq|.

.. _assistant-examples:

Examples
==================================================

.. assistant-examples-start

The following examples show some of the ways you can use the AI Assistant while working in the SQL **Query Editor**.

* :ref:`assistant-example-syntax`
* :ref:`assistant-example-errors`
* :ref:`assistant-example-natural-language`

.. note:: The answers to these questions within your tenant will depend on the query, schema, results, and error information that was provided to the model and may be different than the examples shown in this topic.

.. _assistant-example-natural-language:

Build natural language queries
--------------------------------------------------

.. assistant-example-natural-language-start

You can use natural language---the same types of sentences you use when talking to co-workers and friends---to ask the AI Assistant to help you build queries against any database in the **Customer 360** page.

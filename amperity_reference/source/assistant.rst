Enable or disable AmpAI Assistants
==================================================

.. assistant-enable-disable-start

AmpAI features, including **AmpAI Assistants**, may be enabled (or disabled) by a user who is assigned the **DataGrid Operator** or **DataGrid Administrator** policy.

.. _assistant-howitworks:

How AmpAI Assistants work
==================================================

.. assistant-howitworks-start

**AmpAI Assistants** are powered by LLMs on a private instance of Azure OpenAI Service.

Amperity passes information on the schema information, query and segment examples, results, errors, table usage, and performs a series of research tool calls to improve the quality of results.

.. note:: More detail about how **AmpAI Assistants** work, including data sharing policies, how the model stores data, and what types of data is sent (or not sent), is available from the |ext_amperity_assistant_privacy_faq|.

.. _assistant-journey-prompt-patterns:

Effective prompt patterns
--------------------------------------------------

.. assistant-journey-effective-prompt-patterns-start

To get the best results from the **Journeys AI Assistant**, use specific, clear commands that identify node types, criteria, and destinations.

Good prompts (specific and clear)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following prompts provide the necessary context for the assistant to build accurate steps:

* "Create a split for high value customers, send them to SFMC, everyone else to S3"
* "Add a 7-day delay after the welcome email activation"
* "Split by gender, then for each path split by loyalty tier (gold, silver, bronze)"
* "Merge the two email paths and send a final survey email to everyone"
* "Use Club Members as the inclusion segment"

Why these work:

* **Specific node types:** Clearly identifies splits, delays, activations, or merges.
* **Clear criteria:** Defines the logic (high value, gender, loyalty tier).
* **Explicit destinations:** Names the downstream systems (SFMC, S3).
* **Sequential structure:** Outlines the order of operations.

Bad prompts (vague or ambiguous)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following prompts may result in generic or incorrect journey steps because they lack detail:

* "Build me a journey"
   (What kind of journey? What segments? What destinations?)
* "Make it better"
   (Better how? What should change?)
* "Add personalization"
   (Personalize by what attribute? Where in the journey?)
* "Do the usual thing"
   (The AI doesn't know your specific preferences or history)

Why these fail:

* **No specific actions:** The assistant does not know which nodes to add.
* **Ambiguous goals:** Terms like "better" or "personalization" are subjective without context.
* **Missing information:** Lacks segments, destinations, or split criteria.

.. _assistant-query-example-natural-language-in-store-shoppers:

In-store shoppers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. assistant-example-natural-language-in-store-shoppers-start

**Question**
   "Show me everyone who shopped in-store over the last 30 days."

.. _assistant-segment-examples:

Segment Examples
==================================================

The following examples show some of the ways you can use the **Segments AI Assistant** while working in the **Segment Editor**.

* :ref:`ampai-segments-example-create-segment`
* :ref:`ampai-segments-example-refine-segment`
* :ref:`ampai-segments-example-get-advice-on-segment`

.. note:: The answers to these questions within your tenant will depend on the query, schema, results, and error information that was provided to the model and may be different than the examples shown.


.. _ampai-segments-example-create-segment:

Create a segment
--------------------------------------------------

.. assistant-segments-example-create-segment-start

You can ask the **Segments AI Assistant** to build a segment based on the criteria you lay out.

**Question**
   "Build a segment of my highest value customers based on customer lifetime value."

**Answer**
  The **Segments AI Assistant** will respond similar to:
  
  .. image:: ../../images/assistant-segments-example-create-segment.png
     :width: 600 px
     :alt: Build natural language queries
     :align: left
     :class: no-scaled-link

.. tip:: Be sure to check that the segment created matches what you were looking for, and if not you can guide the **AmpAI Assistant** on how to try again.

   For example, if you ask for a segment of your highest value customers without specifying customer lifetime value as the criteria, you may get a segment based on highest spend over the past year. 

   In cases like this, prompt the **AmpAI Assistant** again and specify how you want to measure value. 

.. ampai-segments-example-create-segment-end


.. _ampai-segments-example-refine-segment:

Refine a segment
--------------------------------------------------

.. ampai-segments-example-refine-segment-start

**Answer**
  The **Segments AI Assistant** will respond similar to:

  .. image:: ../../images/assistant-segments-example-refine-segment.png
     :width: 600 px
     :alt: Build natural language queries
     :align: left
     :class: no-scaled-link

.. ampai-segments-example-refine-segment-end


.. _ampai-segments-example-get-advice-on-segment:

Get advice on your segment
--------------------------------------------------

.. ampai-segments-example-get-advice-on-segment-start

You can ask the **Segments AI Assistant** for guidance on how else you might design your segment to meet the goals of your campaign.

**Question**
   "What other criteria should I consider adding to the segment in order to attract high-value customers who have not recently purchased to buy new offerings in the jeans category?"

**Answer**
  The **Segments AI Assistant** will respond similar to:
  
..  .. image:: ../../images/assistant-segments-example-get-segment-advice.png
..     :width: 600 px
..     :alt: Build natural language queries
..     :align: left

.. code-block:: none

   "To make your segment even more effective for targeting high-value customers
   who have not recently purchased (especially with the goal of promoting new 
   jeans offerings), you might consider adding additional criteria."

Answers will include suggestions similar to:

#. Predicted Affinity for Related Categories:

   Include customers who also have a demonstrated or predicted interest in complementary categories, such as "Tops and T-shirts" or "Accessories," which pair well with jeans.

#. Preferred Channel or Brand:

   Focus on customers who prefer a specific purchase channel or brand, if your new jeans offerings are exclusive or more prominent in certain channels or under specific brands.

#. Contactability:

   Ensure that customers are opted into email or SMS marketing, so your campaigns can actually reach them.

#. Geographic Proximity:

   Filter for customers living in regions where jeans sales or promotions are planned or more likely and in areas with upcoming in-store events.

#. Previous Buyers of Premium Jeans:

   Target customers who have purchased higher-value or premium jeans in the past, as they are more likely to be interested in new, similar offerings.

#. Lapsed but Historically Loyal Customers:

   Identify customers who have bought jeans in the past but have not purchased any recently—they may respond well to a "welcome back" campaign for new jeans.

#. Customer Lifecycle Status:

   Pay attention to customers with a "likely to return" or "at-risk" predicted lifecycle, as they could be nudged toward purchase with targeted messaging.

Predicted lifecycle status
==================================================

.. attribute-predicted-lifecycle-status-start

Predicted lifecycle status represents the likelihood to purchase again, grouped by tiers: "active", "cooling down", "at risk", "highly at risk", and "lost". These tiers are used for two types of customers: repeat customers and one-time buyers.

.. attribute-predicted-lifecycle-status-end

**Repeat customers**

.. attribute-predicted-lifecycle-status-repeat-start

For repeat customers, lifecycle status groupings use the following thresholds:

#. A repeat customer with an "active" lifecycle status has a greater than 60% likelihood to purchase again.
#. A repeat customer with a "cooling down" lifecycle status has a 50-60% likelihood to purchase again.
#. A repeat customer with an "at risk" lifecycle status has a 35-50% likelihood to purchase again.
#. A repeat customer with a "highly at risk" lifecycle status has a 20-35% likelihood to purchase again.
#. A repeat customer with a "lost" lifecycle status has a less than 20% likelihood to purchase again.

.. attribute-predicted-lifecycle-status-repeat-end

**One-time buyers**

.. attribute-predicted-lifecycle-status-onetime-start

For one-time buyers, lifecycle status groupings use the following thresholds:

#. A one-time buyer with an "active" lifecycle status made a purchase within the last 60 days.
#. A one-time buyer with a "cooling down" lifecycle status made a purchase 60-120 days ago.
#. A one-time buyer with an "at risk" lifecycle status made a purchase 120-180 days ago.
#. A one-time buyer with a "highly at risk" lifecycle status made a purchase 180-240 days ago.
#. A one-time buyer with a "lost" lifecycle status made a purchase more than 240 days ago.

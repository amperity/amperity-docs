.. _campaigns-types:

Campaign types
==================================================

.. campaigns-types-start

Amperity supports the following types of campaign workflows:

* :ref:`campaigns-types-onetime`
* :ref:`campaigns-types-recurring`
* :ref:`campaigns-types-multi-channel`

.. campaigns-types-end


.. _campaigns-types-onetime:

One-time campaigns
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-one-time-campaign-start
   :end-before: .. term-one-time-campaign-end

.. campaigns-types-onetime-start

A one-time campaign can be configured to run in a similar manner as a recurring campaign, but with the purpose being to communicate messages to customers they should see only once. For example:

* A welcome message to a customer who has joined a loyalty program.
* A message to a customer who has signed up for a credit card.

.. campaigns-types-onetime-end


.. _campaigns-types-recurring:

Recurring campaigns
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-recurring-campaign-start
   :end-before: .. term-recurring-campaign-end

.. campaigns-types-recurring-start

A recurring campaign has the following components:

#. A state change that initiates a campaign message.
#. A segment that defines a list of customers to which the campaign message applies. This segment can be configured to limit the list to certain types of users, such as only business travelers, high-value customers, and so on.
#. A launch cadence that defines the frequency--daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly--at which the campaign messages are run.

.. campaigns-types-recurring-end


.. _campaigns-types-multi-channel:

Multi-channel campaigns
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-multi-channel-campaign-start
   :end-before: .. term-multi-channel-campaign-end

.. campaigns-types-multi-channel-start

A multichannel campaign defines combinations of sub-audiences and channels to define unique sets strategies, with each applied to a sub-audience.

A multichannel campaign has the following components:

#. A state change that initiates a campaign message.
#. A segment that defines the audience to which the multichannel campaign messages will be applied. This segment can be configured to limit the list to certain types of users, such as only business travelers, high-value customers, and so on.
#. The use of sub-audiences to partition the audience into a variety of campaign channels. Each sub-audience may be configured to have its own control group.
#. A launch cadence that defines the frequency--daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly--at which the campaign messages are run.

.. campaigns-types-multi-channel-end


.. _campaigns-features:

Campaign features
==================================================

.. campaigns-features-start

Campaigns have the following features:

* :ref:`campaigns-attributes`
* :ref:`campaigns-audiences`
* :ref:`campaigns-control-groups`
* :ref:`campaigns-destinations`
* :ref:`campaigns-exclusion-lists`
* :ref:`campaigns-treatment-groups`
* :ref:`campaigns-sub-audiences`
* :ref:`campaigns-timing-and-launch`

.. campaigns-features-end


.. _campaigns-attributes:

Attributes
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-attributes-start

For many |ampiq_destinations|, you may configure the list of attributes (i.e. first name, last name, state, etc.) that are sent for each sub-audience. Click the **Edit attributes** link to open the list of attributes that are available for each destination defined for the audience. Use the drop-down menu to select the destination if there is more than one.

.. campaigns-attributes-end


.. campaigns-attributes-important-start

.. important:: Some destinations only support sending specific attributes. Review the requirements for each destination to ensure that you don't attach unsupported attributes to the campaigns that you send.

.. campaigns-attributes-important-end

.. campaigns-attribute-append-start

You may append attributes that are available in any database table that is available to AmpIQ. Click the **+ Add attribute** link, and then name the attribute, specify from which table that attribute is sourced, and then specify the name of that attribute as it is defined in that table.

.. campaigns-attribute-append-end


.. _campaigns-audiences:

Audiences
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-audiences-start

All campaigns start with an audience. Choose a segment from the **Include** drop-down list. The customers in that list will become the audience for this campaign.

.. campaigns-audiences-end

.. image:: ../../images/mockup-campaigns-select-audience-from-segment.png
   :width: 650 px
   :alt: Choose one (or more) segments to form the audience for this campaign.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. campaigns-audiences-tip-start

.. tip:: When a campaign starts with an audience that is defined by a single segment, you can use the segment insights for that segment as a way to measure the performance of that audience over time.

.. campaigns-audiences-tip-end


.. _campaigns-control-groups:

Control groups
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-control-group-start
   :end-before: .. term-control-group-end

.. campaigns-control-groups-note-start

.. note:: A control group is a completely randomized sample of customers that is pulled from the original audience.

.. campaigns-control-groups-note-end

.. campaigns-control-groups-start

A campaign typically has a single control group, unless sub-audiences are defined within the campaign. Each sub-audience may contain a control group.

.. campaigns-control-groups-end

.. campaigns-control-groups-consistent-membership-start

.. admonition:: Does a control group have consistent audience membership?

   Amperity attempts to maintain (but does not guarantee) consistent audience membership for control groups that are associated with recurring campaigns.

   * When the audience size is unchanged across the campaigns that you send, the membership of the control group will be unchanged.

   * When the audience size changes, the size of the control group also changes. Amperity IDs are added to the control group when the audience size gets bigger and are removed when the audience size gets smaller.

   Audience members that are added to a control group may have belonged to a treatment group on the previous send.

   Audience members that are removed from the control group will belong to a treatment group on the next send.

   For example: A campaign is built using one segment, one control group, and one treatment group. The audience is refreshed weekly and contains a mostly static group of customers, but with small fluctuations in audience size.

   #. Today the size of the audience for the segment is 1200 customers and the size of the control group is 20 percent, or 240 customers. The campaign is sent to 960 customers.
   #. Next week the size of the audience is 1240, which means the size of the control group will be larger (248). The campaign is sent to 992 customers.
   #. And the following week the size of the audience is 1160, which means the size of the control group will be smaller (232). The campaign is sent to 928 customers.

.. _campaigns-destinations:

Destinations
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../amperity_ampiq/source/destinations.rst
   :start-after: .. destinations-howitworks-start

Exclusion lists
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-exclusion-list-start
   :end-before: .. term-exclusion-list-end

.. campaigns-exclusion-lists-start

Sometimes campaigns need to exclude certain members of your audience. For example, a churn prevention campaign is often configured to exclude customers who have opted-out of SMS messaging and/or who have unsubscribed from an email list.

When you need to exclude audience members, choose one (or more) segments from the **Exclude** drop-down list. The customers in an exclusion list will be removed from the audience for this campaign.

.. note:: When you select multiple exclusion lists, audience members will be excluded when they belong to *either* list. This is the same behavior as when the **OR** operator is used in SQL. "Exclude customers from this audience when they belong to segment A *OR* segment B."

.. campaigns-exclusion-lists-end

--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-treatment-group-start
   :end-before: .. term-treatment-group-end

.. campaigns-treatment-groups-start

You may configure more than one treatment group for each audience and sub-audience within a campaign.

.. campaigns-treatment-groups-end


.. _campaigns-sub-audiences:

Sub-audiences
--------------------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-sub-audience-start
   :end-before: .. term-sub-audience-end

.. campaigns-sub-audiences-start

A sub-audience may define users by brand, most commonly purchased sub-brand, product affinity, product category, product type, demographics, etc.

A sub-audience typically represents a set of users for which you have a better understanding of marketing preferences and will receive more specific messaging as part of the campaign. For example, you might split a spring sale email campaign by product affinity so you can send out an email showcasing shorts to customers with a high affinity for shorts and another email advertising t-shirts to customers with a high affinity for t-shirts.

A sub-audience enables you to measure the performance of individual communications in a campaign. For example, you can see how the shorts sub-audience email performed as compared to the t-shirts sub-audience email within the same campaign. Each sub-audience can be configured to use its own control and treatment groups, providing even greater control and flexibility. 

.. note:: The limit for number of sub-audiences per campaign is 60.

.. campaigns-sub-audiences-end


.. _campaigns-timing-and-launch:

Timing and launch dates
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-timing-and-launch-start

A campaign can be configured to be sent once or on a recurring basis. A campaign can also be scheduled (i.e. "to be sent at the time you choose in the future") or to be sent as soon as possible.

.. campaigns-timing-and-launch-end

The download recipients feature allows you to download and see your recipients list. This option provides you with the ability to see details about your recipients, including the Amperity ID and the Treatment ID.

.. campaigns-download-recipients-end

.. campaigns-download-recipients-manual-workflows-start

.. tip:: Downloaded files can enable ad hoc workflows in any downstream tool that supports directly uploading and/or using CSV files. For example, marketing applications like |ext_airship_upload_csv|, |ext_attentive_mobile_upload_csv|, |ext_bluecore_upload_csv|, |ext_braze_upload_csv|, |ext_facebook_custom_audience|, |ext_iterable_upload_csv|, |channel_pinterest|, |channel_reddit_ads|, and |ext_sendgrid_upload_csv| all support directly uploading CSV files.

.. _campaigns-reference-campaign-notifications:

Email notifications
==================================================

.. campaigns-reference-campaign-notifications-start

Email notifications will alert you when there is an issue with campaign delivery. For example, email notifications are sent when Facebook Ads is missing an external identifier or two-factor authorization is not enabled for Google Ads.

Email notifications will describe the issue and the steps that are required to resolve the issue, and will provide a link to the **Workflows** page in Amperity.

.. campaigns-reference-campaign-notifications-end


.. _campaigns-results:

Campaign results
==================================================

.. campaigns-results-overview-start

The campaign results feature allows you to download and see your one-time or recurring campaign results data. This option provides you with the ability to explore campaign results data and measure performance in more detail.

.. image:: ../../images/mockup-campaign-results-standalone.png
   :width: 400 px

   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Use this feature to define a performance measurement time period and then analyze these results for all sub-audience test groups across every single campaign data point. This includes the following data points:

* Revenue metrics
* Conversion rates
* Order characteristics
* Incremental lift

.. tip:: Amperity tracks the purchases of your customers in the audiences lists. The purchase information is based on purchasing behavior across channels. 

If you make any changes to this information downstream (i.e. launching a campaign on a different date then the one you entered into Amperity) they will not be reflected in Amperity.

 .. _recurring-campaign-results-use-cases:
 
Use cases
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-results-use-cases-start

You can use campaign results to determine how to successfully reach out to their customers for the following reasons:

* If your campaign message was effective at converting customers
* Whether one offer or treatment worked better at converting customers (i.e. A/B testing)
* If a campaign drove incremental value (i.e. via a control group holdout)

.. campaigns-results-use-cases-end


.. _campaigns-results-driving:

Driving a campaign
--------------------------------------------------

.. recurring-campaign-results-driving-start

Once you have determined which channel to use for your campaign, you need to determine which is the most effective way to approach a campaign. For instance, if a you decide to send out an email campaign to your customers, you will need to decide which type of email will be most effective. Does the email with the 10% offer bring in more customer orders or does the $10 off email offer give customers more incentive to make a purchase?

.. recurring-campaign-results-driving-end


.. _campaigns-results-amperitys-method:

Amperity's approach
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-results-amperitys-method-start

Amperity creates a 360-degree view of your customers, which includes a complete transaction history. This process uses a stable identifier -- the Amperity ID -- to track customers even when their path to a purchase is non-linear.

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-amperity-id-start
   :end-before: .. term-amperity-id-end
	  
Amperity provides marketers with the following capabilities which gives them a 360 view of their customer's behavior:

* Compares more than one set of marketing data -- via the Amperity ID -- to determine whether customer behavior has changed around a campaign.
* Tracks customer behavior through transactional data and an Amperity ID associated with a campaign.
* Automatically holds back a control group when a campaign is created to test whether a customer will buy something in a store or whether they received an email or not.
* Tracks omnichannel behavior of customers targeted in the test group, as well as the behavior of customers in the control holdout group.
* Compares the behavior of control customers to those who received the marketing treatment and calculates the incremental impact of the campaign.
* Determines whether a customer -- with an Amperity ID associated with a campaign -- has made a purchase within a timeframe set by the marketer. For instance, if a customer were to shop online or in a store. 
* Tests within smaller sub-sets of customer groups to determine how certain components within a campaign affect customer behavior. For example, how was the 10 percent email offer received by customers compared to the $10 off email offer.
* Uses people-based measurement to randomly assign customers to control and treatment groups, which gives you the ability to accurately measure the incremental effects of a campaign. To learn more about people-based measurement, refer to the |people_based_measurement| topic.

.. campaigns-results-amperitys-method-end


.. _campaigns-results-example:
 
Example
--------------------------------------------------

.. campaigns-results-example-start

A marketer downloads campaign results for a campaign that they recently sent out. The the groups that were represented in these results are as follows:

* Facebook Ads
* Postcard
* Email only (control group)

The marketer sees the following campaign results data in the .CSV file that they downloaded:

* How many users were targeted in each group
* When the campaign was launched
* See how much revenue was generated per sub-group
* See how revenue is broken down per user is
* See at a high level how much each group spent.

In this case, the marketer can see that the Facebook Ads sub-group had more conversions than any of the other sub-groups. They can also see that the Facebook Ads sub-group also purchased more items than the other sub-groups.

Thus, the marketer can determine that the Facebook Ads channel is the best option for their marketing campaign.

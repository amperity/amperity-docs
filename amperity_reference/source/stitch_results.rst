.. _stitch-run:

Run Stitch
==================================================

.. stitch-run-start

A Stitch run can be started manually by clicking the **Run** button at the top of the **Stitch** tab. A Stitch run may be started automatically by an upstream process, such as after successful domain table updates that were initiated by courier group automation.

.. stitch-run-end


.. _stitch-run-select-tables:

Select domain tables
--------------------------------------------------

.. stitch-run-select-tables-start

Stitch only runs against selected domain tables. A domain table is made available to Stitch by the **Make available to Stitch** configuration setting in the **Feed Editor**.

A domain table that is made available to Stitch *must also be selected* from the list of domain tables in the **Stitch settings** dialog box.

Each selected table is processed and compared for identity resolution, after which Amperity IDs are assigned to each of your unique customers that are discovered across all domain tables that are included in the Stitch run.

.. stitch-run-select-tables-end

**To add tables to the Stitch run**

.. stitch-run-select-tables-steps-start

From the **Stitch** tab, click **Settings**. This opens the **Stitch settings** dialog box. On the **Stitched tables** tab, select each of the tables to include in Stitch results, and then click **Save**.

After you have selected the list of tables to include in Stitch results, return to the **Stitch** page, and then click **Run**.

.. stitch-run-select-tables-steps-end

.. stitch-run-select-tables-note-start

.. note:: Only tables with the **Make available to Stitch** setting enabled in the **Feed Editor** are available for selection from the **Stitched tables** tab in the **Stitch settings** dialog box.

.. _stitch-run-about:

About the Stitch run
--------------------------------------------------

.. stitch-run-about-start

A Stitch run takes a certain amount of time, depending on the size of the data analyzed and the number of potential pairs in the data. In general, you should expect to wait at least 20 minutes (but as much as 2 hours) for a Stitch run to complete.

You can navigate to other areas of Amperity and do other tasks while waiting for Stitch to complete successfully. Stitch has two notifications: the Stitch run, and then the Stitch report. The UI will refresh with updates when the Stitch report has been generated.

.. stitch-run-about-end

.. stitch-run-important-start

.. important:: Before starting the Stitch run, verify that *all* tables that should be analyzed by Stitch have been :ref:`made available to Stitch <feeds-make-available-to-stitch>` via the **Feed Editor**, that all processes that load data to Amperity (including couriers, feeds, and domain tables) have finished processing, and that all domain tables are selected.

.. _stitch-explore-stitch-results:

Explore Stitch results
==================================================

.. stitch-tab-start

The **Stitch** page shows the outcome of the Stitch process, including the number of unique Amperity IDs in customer data and a series of charts that highlight the connectivity between data sources.

.. stitch-tab-end

.. stitch-explore-stitch-results-start

The Stitch overview provides a high-level set of statistics about the current state of stitched records in Amperity, including :ref:`deduplication rates <stitch-explore-deduplication-rate>` and a way to :ref:`explore Amperity IDs <stitch-explore-by-amperity-id>` in the customer 360 database by :ref:`stitched records <stitch-explore-stitched-records>`, :ref:`cluster graphs <stitch-explore-cluster-graph>`, :ref:`pairwise connections <stitch-explore-pairwise-connections>`, and :ref:`by data source <stitch-explore-by-data-source>`.

.. include:: ../../shared/terms.rst
   :start-after: .. term-amperity-id-start
   :end-before: .. term-amperity-id-end

.. stitch-explore-by-amperity-id-start

As new data is input to Amperity, the Stitch process identifies when new or changed data applies to existing clusters of customer records, and then updates those records, maintains the cluster, and retaining a stable Amperity ID assignment. A new Amperity ID is only created when new individuals are identified.

.. stitch-explore-by-amperity-id-end

.. stitch-explore-by-amperity-id-continued-start

Amperity IDs do not replace primary and foreign keys already assigned in customer data; Amperity IDs exist alongside primary and foreign keys within the customer 360 profile and act as key for finding clusters of unique customer records.

.. stitch-explore-by-amperity-id-continued-end

**To explore by Amperity ID**

.. stitch-explore-by-amperity-id-steps-start

.. _stitch-explore-by-data-source:

Explore by data source
--------------------------------------------------

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-start

The **Stitched Sources** section of the **Stitch** page shows a comparison of domain tables and the record pairs identified both within each data source and across all data sources. This is presented as an UpSet Plot chart with links to the underlying data sources via the **Data Explorer**.

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-end

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-upset-plot-start

The following diagram shows the components of the UpSet plot chart, inclusive of the distribution of Amperity IDs across all data sources, and then for each data source, an individual breakdown of how that data source compares to all other data sources. (An UpSet plot chart will have a row for each data source. This diagram shows the first two only.)

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-upset-plot-explanation-start

Each individual stitched data source can be explored from the UpSet plot. The UpSet plot includes a source-by-source breakdown of stitched data. For each record, a **View source** link is available. This opens the **Data Explorer** and displays a **Schema** for the data source that shows the name of the field as it is defined in customer data, the data type, the Amperity semantic applied to the field, and sample data. A **Sample** shows 100 records from that data source, where each of the fields defined in the customer data source are presented as columns of data.

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-upset-plot-explanation-end

**To explore by data source**

.. stitch-explore-by-data-source-steps-start

   :start-after: .. term-deduplication-rate-start
   :end-before: .. term-deduplication-rate-end

**Example**

.. stitch-explore-deduplication-rate-example-start

A tenant has three sources of customer records represented by tables 1, 2, and 3. In the Stitch report the:

* Total number of records is 314.1k
* Total number of clusters is 212.0k
* Overall deduplication rate is 32.5%
* Individual deduplication rates for three customer records are 7.7%, 6.6%, and 0%

How is this possible? Let's walk through it.

The overall deduplication rate (32.5%) represents the total number of records relative to the number of Amperity IDs. There can be a low deduplication rate on individual tables, but high connectivity between tables.

An UpSet plot chart has a row for each table. In this case, the row for table 1 shows shows 117k source IDs and 108k Amperity IDs. This represents a 7.7% deduplication rate.

.. image:: ../../images/deduplication-rate.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: Deduplication rates for customer records.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

Next compare the overlap between customer records 1 and 3 by hovering over customer record 1. The hover box shows there are more than 69k records shared between tables 1 and 3. This is a significant amount of overlap between two tables and is the primary contributor to the 32.5% overall deduplication rate.

.. admonition:: Deduplication rate, explained

   The deduplication rate is the reduction that occurs when the total number of Amperity IDs are compared to the original source IDs provided in customer data. For example:

   #. Total records: 314.1k. The sum of all records from all tables.
   #. Total clusters: 212.0k. The sum of all clusters from all tables.
   #. Records in table 1: 117k. The sum of all records in table 1.
   #. Clusters in table 1: 108k. The sum of all clusters in table 1.

   The overall deduplication rate is 32.5%:
   
   ::

     100 * [(314.1k - 212.9k) / 314.1k] = 32.5%

   The deduplication rate for table 1 is 7.7%:
   
   ::

     100 * [(117k - 108k) / 117k] = 7.7%


.. important:: Deduplication rate depends! The previous example shows deduplication rate for a database that does not use customer keys:

   ::

      (total customer records - Amperity IDs) /  (total customer records)

   When a database uses customer keys, the math to determine deduplication rate is the same, but the starting point is the customer keys.

   ::

      (total customer key records - Amperity IDs) /  (total customer key records)

.. stitch-explore-deduplication-rate-example-end

**To view deduplication rate**

.. stitch-explore-deduplication-rate-steps-start

#. From the **Stitch** tab, under **Overview**, review the total source IDs and total Amperity IDs.

.. _stitch-view-notifications:

.. stitch-view-notifications:

View notifications
--------------------------------------------------

.. stitch-view-notifications-start

Notifications for Stitch reports that run in the **Stitches** page appear after Amperity creates clusters of records based on the connection between pairs, and then gives each cluster a unique Amperity ID. Notifications typically indicate successful outcomes. Less often, notifications contain details for non-successful outcomes, such as failures related to upstream or downstream processes.

.. stitch-view-notifications-end

.. stitch-view-notifications-context-start

If a notification is about a non-successful outcome, the details for why and what happened can be found in the notification itself. Click **More** to view the full notification. Click **View Workflow** to open the workflow in the **Workflows** page.

In some cases viewing the log files may be helpful. In many cases, fix the root cause of the non-successful outcome, and then rerun the process manually. The **Workflows** page will provide a set of workflow actions that you can initiate directly.

.. stitch-explore-stitch-metrics-context-start

This dialog box identifies the tenant, the time at which the job started, the ID for the Stitch report, and the Stitch ID, and then shows the following details about this Stitch run:

* The collapsed ID count refers to the number of records present after nearly-identical records were removed.
* The related pairs count shows number of unique record pairs that were identified by a blocking strategy.
* The filtered related pairs count shows the number of unique record pairs that scored above the matching category threshold.

The table contains a row for each data source that was made available to this Stitch run, along with columns for each row that show:

* The number of Amperity IDs in the current Stitch run.
* The number of Amperity IDs in the previous Stitch run.
* The number of Amperity IDs in the current Stitch run that were not in the previous Stitch run.
* The number of Amperity IDs that were in the previous Stitch run, but are not in the current Stitch run.
* The number of distinct cluster transitions. A cluster transition occurs when records move from one cluster to another.
* The number of distinct cluster transitions, including those from records added to or deleted from the dataset.

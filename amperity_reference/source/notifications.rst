.. notifications-about-start

Use the recent activity pane to learn more about the state of workflows that are currently running in your tenant and as a starting point for resolving warnings and errors that may be shown for specific workflows.

.. notifications-about-end

.. notifications-sections-start

This topic is broken into the following sections:

#. The first section describes :ref:`notification types <notifications-types>` -- :ref:`Running <notifications-type-running>`, :ref:`Completed <notifications-type-completed>`, :ref:`Warnings <notifications-type-warnings>`, and :ref:`Error <notifications-type-errors>` -- and describes what you should expect from each notification type as they appear in the recent activity pane.

   This section also describes :ref:`the fields that are shown in notifications <notifications-fields>`, such as links to validation reports and workflows, job, trace, IDs for use with troubleshooting, and status indicators, such as the amount of time a workflow ran.

#. The second section describes the notifications that appear within individual pages in the Amperity user interface. These sections are listed alphabetically by page: :ref:`Campaign <notifications-campaigns>`, :ref:`Database <notifications-databases>`, :ref:`Orchestrations <notifications-orchestrations>`, :ref:`Queries <notifications-queries>`, :ref:`Sources <notifications-sources>`, :ref:`Stitch reports <notifications-stitch-reports>`, and :ref:`Stitch runs <notifications-stitch-runs>`.

#. A list of how-tos that are available to workflows, including :ref:`resolving workflow errors <notifications-resolve-workflow-errors>`.

.. _notifications-types:

Notification types
==================================================

.. notifications-types-about-start

All notifications within the recent activity pane fall into one of the following general types:

* :ref:`Running <notifications-type-running>`
* :ref:`Completed <notifications-type-completed>`
* :ref:`Warning <notifications-type-warnings>`
* :ref:`Error <notifications-type-errors>`

.. notifications-types-about-end

.. notifications-types-important-start

.. important:: Notifications fall into general behaviors, but all notifications within your tenant are specific to your tenant and reflect how your tenant is configured. The names of data sources, feeds, couriers, tables, databases, queries, orchestrations, destinations, and campaigns will appear in the notifications.

   If there is an error, such as a processing error related to a specific column within a custom table, the notification will contain the names you chose for the custom table and also for the columns within that table.

   This topic details what you should expect to see within your tenant, but it is not possible to know in advance the specific notifications that you may experience.

   If you are unable to resolve a warning or an error using workflow actions, please contact Amperity support.

.. notifications-types-important-end


.. _notifications-type-running:

Running
--------------------------------------------------

.. notifications-type-status-start

A running notification -- indicated by the |notification-running| icon -- is shown when a workflow is currently running, but has not finished every step in the workflow.

.. notifications-type-status-end

.. image:: ../../images/notification-type-running.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: A notification is running.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. notifications-type-running-context-start

For example, a notification for a workflow that is running is updated with details for each step in that workflow as it completes. You can open the **Workflows** page and view details for each step that is taken by that workflow as they are taken.

.. notifications-type-running-context-start


.. _notifications-type-completed:

Completed
--------------------------------------------------

.. notifications-type-completed-start

A completed notification -- indicated by the |notification-complete| icon -- is shown when the workflow has finished running and all steps in that workflow were successful. This is the most common type of notification that you will see in the notification pane in your daily production tenant.

.. notifications-type-completed-end

.. image:: ../../images/notification-type-status.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: A notification has finished running with no errors or warnings.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. notifications-type-completed-context-start

For example, a notification for a workflow that has completed successfully will contain links to:

* A **Validation Report**
* A **View Details** modal that shows how long it took for each table to be updated
* A page for the workflow in the **Workflows** page, from which you can review details for each step in the workflow

.. notifications-type-completed-context-start


.. _notifications-type-warnings:

Warnings
--------------------------------------------------

.. notifications-type-warnings-start

A warning notification -- indicated by the |notification-alert| icon -- is shown when a workflow is able to complete all steps, but detects issues with one (or more) steps within the workflow.

.. notifications-type-warnings-end

.. image:: ../../images/notification-type-alert.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: A notification has finished running, but is showing a warning.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. notifications-type-warnings-context-start

For example, a notification for a workflow that has detected an issue will show the warning icon |notification-alert| along with a message that describes the issue, such as:

::

   Unique validation failed for database "Customer 360" table
   "Unified_Transactions" column "order_id"

and then will contain links to:

* A **Validation Report**
* A **View Details** modal that shows how long it took for each table to be updated
* A page for the workflow in the **Workflows** page, from which you can review details for each step in the workflow

.. important:: Each warning is specific to a step in the workflow. In many cases a warning will not prevent the completion of your daily workflow, but it does indicate that a step in your workflow requires attention and that you should work to resolve what caused it as soon as possible.

.. notifications-type-warnings-context-start


.. _notifications-type-errors:

Errors
--------------------------------------------------

.. notifications-type-errors-start

An error notification -- indicated by the |notification-error| icon -- is shown when a workflow is unable to complete all steps.

.. notifications-type-errors-end

.. image:: ../../images/notification-type-error.png
   :width: 600 px
   :alt: A notification has finished running, but is showing an error.
   :align: left
   :class: no-scaled-link

.. notifications-type-errors-context-start

For example, a notification for a workflow that contains an error will show the error icon |notification-error| and the workflow will stop.

A message is shown that describes the error, such as:

::

   Error analyzing table "Unified_Transactions" in database "C360":
   cannot resolve '`loyalty_tier`' given input columns:
   [Unified_Customer.address, Unified_Customer.address2, ... ]

.. caution:: Each error is specific to a step in that workflow. In all cases an error will prevent the completion of that workflow. You should open the **Workflows** page, review the error in the workflow, and then work to resolve the error immediately.

   Each workflow error will present a list of suggested workflow actions that are specific to this workflow error:

   .. image:: ../../images/workflow-actions-modal.png
      :width: 300 px
      :alt: An example of the workflow actions for a specific workflow error.
      :align: left
      :class: no-scaled-link

   Select the radio button for the workflow action that you determine to be the best way to resolve this error, after which the workflow will perform that action.
   
.. tip:: If you are unable to resolve an error, please contact your Amperity representative.

  .. note:: For queries that return large results sets, do the following:

     #. Review the query and look for ways to optimize the SQL so that it returns smaller results sets.
     #. Configure the query to run in performance mode. This wraps a **CREATE TABLE** operation around the **SELECT** statement in the query, writes the results to an Apache Parquet file, and then makes that file available to Amperity as a table. Queries that run in `performance mode can have limitations <https://docs.amperity.com/reference/queries.html#enable-performance-mode>`__.

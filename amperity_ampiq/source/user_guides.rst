Campaigns
==================================================

A campaign is a message or offer that is sent to a specific group of customers or recipients. A campaign may have a single audience with a single step or a campaign may have a series of steps where, at each step, an audience is filtered to match that stage of the campaign, and is then sent to a specific set of marketing applications for customer activation during that phase of the campaign.

One-time buyers

.. user-guides-onetime-buyers-start

Customer retention is critical for the long-term growth of your brand. It is not enough to acquire a customer who makes a single purchase. It is essential to find ways to convince your one-time buyers to become long-term, repeat customers.

Every one-time buyer represents a unique opportunity to your brand. They have made their first purchase and have given your brand an opportunity to convince them to make a second purchase and become a repeat customer.

Paid media
==================================================

RFM scores
==================================================

.. user-guides-rfm-scores-start

RFM scores represents three dimensions:

* Recency. How recently did the customer purchase?
* Frequency. How often does the customer purchase?
* Monetary. How much does the customer spend?

A score for recency, frequency, and monetary is assigned on a scale of 1-10, and is then aggregated into a combined RFM score that is assigned on a scale of “111” (the lowest possible RFM score) to “101010” (the highest possible RFM score, or “three ‘10’ scores”). Maximum scores represent preferred behaviors.

.. _user-guides-segments:

Segments
==================================================

.. user-guides-segments-start

When the segment is ready, activate it, and then use it use it in a campaign to send to your preferred destinations for customer activation.

.. _user-guides-sql-queries:

SQL queries
==================================================

.. user-guides-sql-queries-start

A SQL query runs against any database table in your customer 360 database and returns a set of results that are defined by that query. Use SQL queries to support any downstream use case, such as specific audience types for specific marketing applications, sending customer profiles and interaction histories to data analytics tools, and so on. Each query returns a refined and filtered subset of useful customer data.

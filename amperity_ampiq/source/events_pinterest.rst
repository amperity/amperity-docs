Upload a CSV file that contains `offline conversions <https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/upload-conversions-with-ads-manager>`__ |ext_link| to |destination-name|, after which |destination-name| will match campaigns to these conversions so your brand can review total conversions in |destination-name| as they relate to all active campaigns.

.. events-pinterest-overview-tip-start

.. tip:: Upload this CSV file at least once a month and send conversion data within 30 days of each conversion occurrence to |destination-name|. Keep the size of the CSV file under 5 GB with fewer than 10 million rows.

Build a query
==================================================

.. events-pinterest-build-query-start

Use a query to return the fields that align to the customer and event data fields supported by |destination-name| for use with `offline conversions <https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/upload-conversions-with-ads-manager>`__ |ext_link|.

For example:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT
     mc.TO_HEX(SHA256(TO_UTF8(LOWER(TRIM(email))))) AS EMAIL
     TO_HEX(SHA256(TO_UTF8(LOWER(TRIM(mc.email))))) AS email
     ,ut.order_datetime AS event_time
     ,'checkout' AS event_type
     ,'offline' AS event_source
     ,ut.order_revenue AS value
     ,ut.order_id AS order_id
     ,ut.order_quantity AS quantity
   FROM Merged_Customers mc
   INNER JOIN Unified_Transactions ut
   ON mc.amperity_id = ut.amperity_id
   WHERE mc.email IS NOT NULL

You can download the results of this query directly from the **Query Editor** in Amperity or you can use an orchestration to send the CSV file to cloud storage or an SFTP bucket.

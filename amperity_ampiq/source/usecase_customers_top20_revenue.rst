Which customers are your top 20-percent for revenue during the previous year?

Use the monetary component of approximate RFM scores to quickly find customers who are in the top 20-percent, along with the percentage of total revenue those customers represent.

.. tip:: Divide percentage of revenue by the number of customers in the top 20 to find the average percentage of revenue that is generated by each customer across all of your brands, stores, channels, and regions.

       Click the **Refresh** button located on the right side of the **Segment Editor** to see how many customers are in your segment, how much they spent in the past year, how many are active, and how many of them could belong to a future campaign.

       .. tip:: Use good naming patterns to ensure that you can always find your segments when you need them. Be sure to include the brand name and/or the region name if you have multiple brands or have multiple regions and want to build segments that are brand- and/or region-specific.

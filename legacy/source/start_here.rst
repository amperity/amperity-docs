This collection describes legacy configuration experiences that have been deprecated. In some cases, for some tenants, the legacy configuration experience may still be available.

This collection includes:

* :doc:`Data templates <data_templates>`. Previously destinations supported data templates to allow for a single destination to be configured for more than one type of orchestration or campaign. Data templates have been replaced by orchestration- and campaign-specific configuration settings.

* Destinations. All configuration settings for destinations have been moved into orchestration- and campaign-specific configuration experiences. Data templates are not required. Use the left-side navigation to find a legacy destination topic.

* :doc:`Sources <source_amazon_s3>`. The configuration workflow for file-based sources for SFTP, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob Storage are improved. In specific cases the legacy configuration is still necessary.

Credentials information that is shared across all credentials steps. The pathway into sources is different from destinations. Some credentials--Amazon S3, for example--will have bespoke steps. Keep those either in the source or destination topics (if they are unique) or use a shared file like ``/shared/amazon_s3`` to ensure reusability.


**CREDENTIALS - INTRO, SOURCES & DESTINATIONS**

.. credentials-sources-intro-start

The following steps describe how to configure Amperity to connect to |source-name|.

.. credentials-sources-intro-end


.. credentials-destinations-intro-start

The following steps describe how to configure Amperity to connect to |destination-name|.

.. important:: These steps may require administrator access to |destination-name|. Configure this destination in a sandbox, verify the workflow, and then push these changes to your Amperity production tenant.

.. tip:: Use SnapPass to securely share configuration details for |source-name| between your company and your Amperity representative.




**TEMPLATE SECTIONS FOR DATA SOURCES**

This topic contains the templated sections for all of the "Pull from xxxxx" topics in /operator/. You must use these templated sections. Use the beginning of the topic to introduce anything that is source-specific. You cannot add source-specific content within the templated sections outside of providing the variables for "source name", "feed name", and "example filename". The "domain table name" is a concatenation of "source name" + "feed name".

In certain cases, a source topic will require *some* customization within the templated sections. See the Salesforce Sales Cloud topic, **Run courier manually** section for how to do this.

**Get details**


FIVETRAN COURIERS
FIVETRAN COURIERS
FIVETRAN COURIERS

Fivetran couriers share some common details: 1) request to enable, 2) access to Snowflake, 3) the introduction, 4) note about Fivetran, 5) important about not storing data with 3, 4, and 5 tucked into consistent locations. The steps in-between 1) and 2) are custom to each topic.

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-overview-start

Amperity can pull data from |source-name| by using Fivetran as the interface to |source-interface|. This requires the following configuration details:

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-overview-end

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-connect-start

.. note:: Amperity connects to |source-name| using Fivetran, which is an application that must be configured for your instance of |source-name|. Fivetran connects to |source-name|, and then pulls this data directly to a Snowflake instance that is managed by Amperity. Use a Snowflake data source to pull these tables from that Snowflake instance to Amperity.

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-connect-end

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-does-not-store-data-start

.. important:: Fivetran does not store any data that is pulled to Amperity from |source-name|.

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-does-not-store-data-end

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-request-to-enable-start

A request to Amperity support to enable |source-name| as a data source for your tenant.

.. important:: Please allow for up to 24 hours after making the request for the |source-name| connection to be enabled.

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-request-to-enable-end

.. sources-get-details-fivetran-access-to-snowflake-start

Access to the instance of Snowflake that stores the |source-name| data tables that were pulled by Fivetran.

.. important:: The amount of time required to complete the initial population of data from |source-name| to Snowflake can vary, depending on the amount of data. Please allow for up 72 hours for this process to complete as a general guideline.

This section applies ONLY to data sources that use SFTP.

.. sources-add-courier-entities-list-intro-sftp-only-start

An entites list defines the list of files to be pulled to Amperity, along with any file-specific details (such as file name, file type, if header rows are required, and so on).

.. sources-add-courier-entities-list-intro-sftp-only-end

.. sources-add-courier-entities-list-note-sftp-only-start

.. note:: You may configure files as required (``"object/optional": false``) or optional (``"object/optional": true``.) A courier will fail if a required file is not available or, if all files in the fileset are optional, at least one of those files is not available.

.. sources-add-courier-entities-list-note-sftp-only-end

This section has an introduction to entities lists and a note about required/optional file behaviors. In-between you show an example of an entities list that is appropriate for each SFTP data source. All data sources share the same add couriers steps. This section applies to SFTP connectors only.

#. From the **Sources** tab, click **Add Courier**. The **Select integration** page opens.
#. Find, and then click the row that contains |plugin-name|. The **Add Courier** page opens.

   This automatically selects |credential-type| as the **Credential Type**. Add the hostname for the location from which data is pulled. For example: |sftp-hostname|.
#. Enter the name of the courier. For example: "|source-name|".
#. From the **Credential** drop-down, select **Create a new credential**. This opens the **Create New Credential** page.
#. From the **Credential** drop-down, select **Create a new credential**. This opens the **Create New Credential** dialog box. Enter a name for the credential (typically "|source-name|"), and then enter the username and password required to access this location.
#. Under **Settings** configure the list of files to pull to Amperity. Configure the **Entities List** for each file to be loaded to Amperity.

   .. note:: If the file is contained within a ZIP archive, you may need to specify the fully qualified filename within the ZIP archive. For example, to import a file named "items.csv" you may need to specify "export\items.csv".
#. Under **Settings** set the load operations to a string that is obviously incorrect, such as ``df-xxxxxx``. (You may also set the load operation to empty: ``{}``.)

   .. tip:: If you use an obviously incorrect string, the load operation settings will be saved in the courier configuration. After the feed is configured and activated you can edit the courier, and then update the feed ID with the correct identifier.

   .. caution:: If load operations are not set to ``{}`` the validation test for the courier configuration settings will fail.

.. sources-add-courier-fivetran-load-operation-start

Load operations associate each table in the list of tables to a feed. (The initial setup for this courier will use an incorrect feed ID -- ``df-xxxxxx``.)

.. sources-add-courier-fivetran-load-operation-end

.. sources-add-courier-fivetran-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, select the courier added for |source-name|, and then click **Edit Courier**.
#. Add a name for the courier. For example: "|source-name| (Snowflake)".
#. Select the "Snowflake" plugin, and then select the credential type.
#. Enter the username and password. This should be the Amperity username and password created in Snowflake that allows Amperity to access the instance of Snowflake that stores |source-name| data tables for your tenant.
#. Complete the credentials, account name, and region ID settings.
#. Define the list of tables to pull to Amperity:

   ::

      [
        "table.name.one",
        "table.name.two"
        "table.name.etc"
      ]

#. Enter the name of the Snowflake stage.
#. Optional. Use a query to select specific columns from a Snowflake table prior to pulling those results to Amperity. Click "Add Snowflake query". In the expanded box, provide a unique query name. A query name may contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z), underscores, hyphens, and/or periods. For example: "Query_name.12-345a".

   Use `Snowflake query syntax <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs.html>`__ |ext_link| to build a query to run against a table that is to be pulled to Amperity.

   .. important:: The name of the query must be added to the **file** parameter within the load operations. For example:

      ::

         "FEED_ID": [
           {
             "type": "load",
             "file": "Query_name.12-345a"
           }
#. For each table to be sent to Amperity, define the load operations using the feed ID for the feed that is associated with that table.

   Set the load operations to a string that is obviously incorrect, such as ``df-xxxxxx``. (You may also set the load operation to empty: ``{}``.)

   .. tip:: If you use an obviously incorrect string, the load operation settings will be saved in the courier configuration. After the schema for the feed is defined and the feed is activated, you can edit the courier and replace the feed ID with the correct identifier.

   .. caution:: If load operations are not set to ``{}`` or are not set to an obviously incorrect string the validation test for the courier configuration settings will fail.

**Get sample files**

This section has three possible introductions: one for files, another for Snowflake, and another for Fivetran. Fivetran does not have a howto.

.. sources-get-sample-files-start

Every |source-name| file that is pulled to Amperity must be configured as a feed. Before you can configure each feed you need to know the schema of that file. Run the courier without load operations to bring sample files from |source-name| to Amperity, and then use each of those files to configure a feed.

.. sources-get-sample-files-end

.. sources-get-sample-files-fivetran-start

Run the |source-name| courier to pull sample files to Amperity for each of the tables configured in the load operation. Use these sample files to configure a feed for each |source-name| table to be loaded to Amperity.

.. important:: The courier run will fail, but this process will successfully return a list of files, one for each table that was defined in the courier load operation. Use these files to define the feed schema.

.. sources-get-sample-files-fivetran-end

.. sources-get-sample-files-snowflake-start

A sample CSV file may be output from Snowflake, and then uploaded to Amperity while adding a feed.

.. sources-get-sample-files-snowflake-end

.. sources-get-sample-files-steps-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, open the menu for a courier configured for |source-name| with empty load operations, and then select **Run**. The **Run Courier** dialog box opens.
#. Select **Load data from a specific day**, and then select today's date.
#. Click **Run**.

   .. important:: The courier run will fail, but this process will successfully return a list of files from |source-name|.

   These files will be available for selection as an existing source from the **Add Feed** dialog box.
#. Wait for the notification for this courier run to return an error similar to:

   ::

      Error running load-operations task
      Cannot find required feeds: "df-xxxxxx"

**Add feeds**

This section starts with the glossary term for feeds, then has a note. There are three styles for notes: one for files, one for Fivetran, and one for Snowflake. Slighly different. Then there are two styles for steps: one for Snowflake and another for everything else.

.. sources-add-feed-note-file-start

.. note:: A feed must be added for *each* file that is pulled from |source-name|, including all files that contain customer records and interaction records, along with any other files that will be used to support downstream workflows.

.. sources-add-feed-note-file-end

.. 
.. For Hubspot, Klaviyo, Shopify, Zendesk, and all other Fivetran-based sources.
.. 

.. sources-add-feed-note-fivetran-start

.. note:: A feed must be added for *each* table that is pulled from |source-name|, including all tables that contain customer records and interaction records, along with any other tables that will be used to support downstream workflows. Use the CSV files that were pulled to Amperity to define the schema for each feed.

.. sources-add-feed-note-fivetran-end

.. 
.. For Snowflake itself running on either Amazon AWS or Azure.
.. 

.. sources-add-feed-note-snowflake-start

.. note:: A feed must be added for *each* table that is pulled from |source-name|, including all tables that contain customer records and interaction records, along with any other tables that will be used to support downstream workflows. Use the CSV files that were pulled to Amperity to define the schema for each feed.

.. sources-add-feed-note-snowflake-end

**To add a feed (non-Snowflake)**

.. sources-add-feed-steps-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, click **Add Feed**. This opens the **Add Feed** dialog box.
#. Under **Data Source**, select **Create new source**, and then enter "|source-name|".
#. Enter the name of the feed in **Feed Name**. For example: "|feed-name|".

   .. tip:: The name of the domain table will be "<data-source-name>:<feed-name>". For example: "|domain-table-name|".

#. Under **Sample File**, select **Select existing file**, and then choose from the list of files. For example: "|example-filename|".

   .. tip:: The list of files that is available from this drop-down menu is sorted from newest to oldest.
#. Select **Load sample file on feed activation**.
#. Click **Continue**. This opens the **Feed Editor** page.
#. Select the primary key.
#. Apply semantic tags to customer records and interaction records, as appropriate.
#. Under **Last updated field**, specify which field best describes when records in the table were last updated.

   .. tip:: Choose **Generate an "updated" field** to have Amperity generate this field. This is the recommended option unless there is a field already in the table that reliably provides this data.

#. For feeds with customer records (PII data), select **Make available to Stitch**.
#. Click **Activate**. Wait for the feed to finish loading data to the domain table, and then review the sample data for that domain table from the **Data Explorer**.

.. sources-add-feed-steps-end

**To add a feed (Snowflake)**

.. sources-add-feed-steps-snowflake-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, click **Add Feed**.
#. Add a data source named Snowflake.

   .. tip:: Use the same data source for all Snowflake table objects that are to be sent to Amperity.
#. Enter the name of the Snowflake table object as the name of the feed.
#. Upload a CSV file.
#. Click **Continue**.
#. Choose the primary key, apply semantics, adjust field types, verify any fields that are marked required, and then click **Activate**.

.. sources-add-feed-steps-snowflake-end




**Add load operations**

The introduction to this section is literally the same for all data sources and uses the "source name" variable. This section has a custom section that shows an example load operation, which is positioned after the introduction and before the how-to.

.. sources-add-load-operation-start

After the feeds are activated and domain tables are available, add the load operations to the courier used for |source-name|.

.. sources-add-load-operation-end

**Example for example load operations**

There are two example intros, one for files and one for Fivetran.

.. sources-add-load-operation-example-intro-start

Load operations must specify each file that will be pulled to Amperity from |source-name|.

.. sources-add-load-operation-example-intro-end

.. sources-add-load-operation-example-intro-fivetran-start

Load operations must specify each table that will be pulled to Amperity from |source-name|.

.. sources-add-load-operation-example-intro-fivetran-end

.. 
.. each source has its own example operation that should go in this spot
.. do not pull this section to the file; each of these is unique
.. 

.. source-xxxxx-add-load-operations-example-start

Load operations must specify each file that will be pulled to Amperity from |source-name|. For example:

::

   {
     "CUSTOMER-RECORDS-FEED-ID": [
       {
         "type": "truncate"
       },
       {
         "type": "load",
         "file": "customer-records"
       }
     ],
     "TRANSACTION-RECORDS-FEED-ID": [
       {
         "type": "load",
         "file": "transaction-records"
       }
     ]
   }

.. source-xxxxx-add-load-operations-example-end

**To add load operations**

.. sources-add-load-operation-steps-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, open the menu for the courier that was configured for |source-name|, and then select **Edit**. The **Edit Courier** dialog box opens.
#. Edit the load operations for each of the feeds that were configured for |source-name| so they have the correct feed ID.
#. Click **Save**.

.. sources-add-load-operation-steps-end




**Run courier manually**

This section is literally the same for all data sources.

.. sources-run-courier-start

Run the courier again. This time, because the load operations are present and the feeds are configured, the courier will pull data from |source-name|.

.. sources-run-courier-end

**To run the courier manually**

.. sources-run-courier-steps-start

#. From the **Sources** tab, open the |fa-kebab| menu for the courier with updated load operations that is configured for |source-name|, and then select **Run**. The **Run Courier** dialog box opens.
#. Select the load option, either for a specific time period or all available data. Actual data will be loaded to a domain table because the feed is configured.
#. Click **Run**.

   This time the notification will return a message similar to:

   ::

      Completed in 5 minutes 12 seconds

.. sources-run-courier-steps-end

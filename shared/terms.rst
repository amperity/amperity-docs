**trivial duplicate**

.. term-trivial-duplicate-start

A trivial duplicate is a set of nearly-identical records that share enough matching PII to clearly identify a single unique individual. Trivial duplicates are identified by Stitch early in the identity resolution process. Only one of these records is passed downstream for additional Stitch processing; the other records -- the trivial duplicates -- are not.

.. term-trivial-duplicate-end

.. term-trivial-duplicate-qualified-start

A qualified trivial duplicate is a set of records with enough matching PII to score 3.0 (or greater) and were grouped together.

**TSV**, **tab-separated values**

.. term-tsv-start

A |ext_tsv| file is a delimited text file that uses a tab to separate values. A TSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by tabs. The use of the tab as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.

Each bar in the UpSet Plot shows the number of Amperity IDs that share records from the included sources. Therefore, each bar represents a mutually exclusive set of Amperity IDs.

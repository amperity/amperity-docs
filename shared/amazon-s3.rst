This topic contains IAM and role ARN configuration content that is included into any source or destination topic that pulls data from or sends data to an Amazon S3 bucket.

IAM secrets and keys are possible, but Amperity prefers the role ARN configuration.

This is true even for Snowflake, because when Snowflake runs on AWS, we use an S3 bucket to stage the data into a SQL lite instance that holds the data in-between Amperity and Snowflake. That said, at the moment, we are not sharing any of this content into either of the AWS-based Snowflake topics.

Amperity prefers to pull data from and send data to customer-managed cloud storage.

Amperity requires using cross-account role assumption to manage access to Amazon S3 to ensure that customer-managed security policies control access to data.

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-overview-end

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-context-start

This approach ensures that customers can:

* Directly manage the IAM policies that control access to data
* Directly manage the files that are available within the Amazon S3 bucket
* Modify access without requiring involvement by Amperity; access may be revoked at any time by either Amazon AWS account, after which data sharing ends immediately
* Directly troubleshoot incomplete or missing files

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-context-end

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-setup-start

After setting up cross-account role assumption, a list of files by filename and file type, along with any sample files, must be made available to allow for feed creation. These files may be placed directly into the shared location after cross-account role assumption is configured.

.. admonition:: Can I use an Amazon AWS Access Point?

   Yes, but with the following limitations:

   #. The direction of access is Amperity access files that are located in a customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket
   #. A credential-free role-to-role access pattern is used
   #. Traffic is not restricted to VPC-only

.. TODO: The candidate /internal/source_amazon_s3 topic has a couple blocks of text in-between these paragraphs that might be shareable on a non-Snowflake use case. Right now, this topic is being single-sourced for updating Snowflake with role ARN info.

.. TODO: The following section is in Snowflake topics, so keep edits neutral. This should remain a common intro to the steps to do cross-account roles. These are different by source/destination, so each has bespoke steps, Snowflake included.



**Cross-account roles -- STEPS**

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-intro-done-by-admins-start

The following steps describe how to configure Amperity to use cross-account role assumption to pull data from (or push data to) a customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket.

.. important:: These steps require configuration changes to customer-managed Amazon AWS accounts and must be done by users with administrative access.

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-intro-done-by-admins-end


**Cross-account roles -- STEP ONE**

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-add-source-intro-start

From the **Credentials** dialog box, enter a name for the credential, select the **iam-role-to-role** credential type, and then select "Create new credential".

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-add-source-intro-end



**Cross-account roles -- STEP TWO**

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-settings-intro-start

Next configure the settings that are specific to cross-account role assumption.

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-settings-intro-end

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-settings-details-start

The values for the **Amperity Role ARN** and **External ID** fields -- the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your Amperity tenant and its external ID -- are provided automatically.

You must provide the values for the **Target Role ARN** and **S3 Bucket Name** fields. Enter the target role ARN for the IAM role that Amperity will use to access the customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket, and then enter the name of the Amazon S3 bucket.

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-settings-details-end


**Cross-account roles -- STEP THREE**

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-policy-example-intro-start

Review the following sample policy, and then add a similar policy to the customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket that allows Amperity access to the bucket. Add this policy as a trusted policy to the IAM role that is used to manage access to the customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket.

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-policy-example-intro-end

.. sources-amazon-s3-cross-account-roles-steps-policy-example-start

The policy for the customer-managed Amazon S3 bucket is unique, but will be similar to:

.. code-block:: salt
   :linenos:

   {
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "AllowAmperityAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/resource"
          },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": "01234567890123456789"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }

The value for the role ARN is similar to:

::

   arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/prod/amperity-plugin

An external ID is an alphanumeric string between 2-1224 characters (without spaces) and may include the following symbols: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at (@), colon (:), forward slash (/), and hyphen (-).

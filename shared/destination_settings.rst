Settings unique to Oracle Eloqua.

**Audience primary key**

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-audience-primary-key-start

Map email address values to the database type **C_EmailAddress** before sending shared list audiences to |destination-name|.

You may send audience attributes. Some attributes must map to `default attributes <https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-user/Help/ContactFields/ContactFieldsDefinitions.htm>`__ |ext_link|. You may define `custom attributes <https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-user/Help/ContactFields/Tasks/CreatingContactFields.htm>`__ |ext_link|.

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-audience-primary-key-end

**Shared list name**

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-start

The name of the shared list.

Use filename templates to configure Amperity to support managing more than one shared list. For example:

1. A timestamp at the end of a filename template--**Early_Purchasers_{{format:'MM-dd-yyyy'}}.csv**--creates a new shared list each time Amperity sends an audience. The filename always has "Early Purchasers", but each send has a unique datestamp.

2. A campaign configured only for campaign name and group name--**{{ campaign_name }} - {{ group_name }}**--updates the same shared list each time Amperity sends the audience.

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-end

.. vale off

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-caution-start

You may add custom attributes to the shared list as long as each custom attribute maps to the database name assigned to the custom contact field by |destination-name|.

This approach requires adding an empty shared list to |destination-name|, and then adding any custom contact fields to that shared list. This generates the database name, which is typically, but not always, prefixed with **C_**.

.. setting-salesforce-sales-cloud-load-data-in-parallel-end

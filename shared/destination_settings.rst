**ORACLE ELOQUA**

This section contains settings that are unique to Oracle Eloqua.

**Audience primary key**

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-audience-primary-key-start

The primary key for the shared list: **C_EmailAddress**.

An email address (mapped to the database type **C_EmailAddress**) is the only requirement for sending audiences to |destination-name| for use as a shared list.

Additional attributes may be sent. Some must be mapped to the |ext_oracle_eloqua_shared_lists_defaults|; |ext_oracle_eloqua_shared_lists_custom| may be defined.

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-audience-primary-key-end

**Shared list name**

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-start

The name of the shared list to be managed by Amperity.

Use filename templates to configure Amperity to support managing more than one shared list. For example:

* A timestamp at the end of a filename template---**Early_Purchasers_{{format:'MM-dd-yyyy'}}.csv**---will create a new shared list each time an audience is sent from Amperity. The shared list will always be titled "Early Purchasers", but will have a unique datestamp.
* A campaign that is configured only for campaign name and group name---**{{ campaign_name }} - {{ group_name }}**---will update the same shared list each time the audience is sent from Amperity.

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-end

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-caution-start

You may add custom attributes to the shared list as long as each custom attribute is mapped to the database name that was assigned to the custom contact field by |destination-name|.

This approach requires adding an empty shared list to |destination-name|, and then adding any custom contact fields to that shared list. This will generate the database name, which is typically (but not always) prefixed with **C_**.

.. setting-oracle-eloqua-shared-list-name-caution-end

**Load data in parallel?**

.. setting-salesforce-sales-cloud-load-data-in-parallel-start

When enabled, NULL values in data sent from Amperity will be ignored during "Upsert" operations. If a field from Amperity is NULL and there is a value in the corresponding Salesforce object, the value in the Salesforce object will be preserved.

.. setting-salesforce-sales-cloud-load-data-in-parallel-end

.. setting-salesforce-sales-cloud-load-data-in-parallel-caution-start

Enabling parallelism may cause Salesforce to process batches in parallel. This may improve performance, but comes with the risk of introducing failures due to locking. It is possible for more than one batch to attempt to obtain a lock on the same row, causing one (or both) batches to fail.

.. setting-salesforce-sales-cloud-load-data-in-parallel-caution-end

Attentive
==================================================

This is a legacy SFTP connector and should not be used to manage audiences in |destination-name|.

Managing audiences in |destination-name|, along with audience attributes about that audience requires using a combination of the following destinations:

* Use the `Attentive destination <https://docs.amperity.com/datagrid/destination_attentive_mobile.html#audience-segments>`__ |ext_link| to send audience segments to Attentive using a SFTP-based process.
* Use the `Attentive API destination <https://docs.amperity.com/datagrid/destination_attentive_mobile.html#custom-attributes-api>`__ |ext_link| to send customer attributes about that audience using the Custom Attributes API.

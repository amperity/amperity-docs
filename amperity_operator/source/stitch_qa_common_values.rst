When to use
==================================================

.. stitch-qa-query-common-values-use-start

#. Run this query to display common values.
#. Review the top results and investigate records to identify trends.
#. For each common value, attempt to identify why it has so many records associated with it. For example, is it a company email address? A business address?
#. Review all associated records to ensure that records associated with it are clustered or split appropriately.
#. Identify if any values should be added to the :doc:`bad-values blocklist <blocklist_bad_values>`.
#. If anomalies are present, investigate each cluster individually.

.. _source-adobe-analytics-get-details:

Get details
==================================================

.. source-adobe-analytics-get-details-start

Adobe Analytics may be configured to send data to Amperity using SFTP, Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage as a staging step, from which Amperity is configured to pull data. This requires the following configuration details:

#. The RSA public key to use for PGP encryption.

   This key must be downloaded from the Adobe Analytics console, and then sent to Amperity using SnapPass. A representative of Amperity will add the certificate to the SFTP location that is built into Amperity (**<tenant>.sftp.amperity.com**).

   .. tip:: Amperity provides a built-in SFTP connector for |source-name| with some pre-configured settings.

      You may configure |source-name| to send data to :doc:`Amazon S3 <source_amazon_s3>` or :doc:`Azure Blob Storage <source_azure_blob_storage>`, after which you would use that data source to configure your connection to |source-name|. The connection steps will change (from SFTP to Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and are outlined in those topics, but all other steps are the same as outlined in this topic.

#. From the Adobe Anaytics admin console, configure an `Adobe Analytics Data Feed <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/analytics-data-feed/data-feed-overview.html>`__ |ext_link|. Specify the connection type as **SFTP**, port **22**, the host name (**<tenant>.sftp.amperity.com**), and then the folder path to which that data is sent. For example: **/tenant/**.

#. From the Adobe Analytics console, configure the contents of the data feed to contain a limited set of fields. (Clickstream data can contain hundreds or even thousands of fields. Many of these are not useful for workflows within Amperity).

   Trim the list of fields that are sent to Amperity.

   Ensure that an authentication key is present in the data, such as an ID login or cookie, that links to the internal ID system to ensure that data associated with customers is usable.

   Select only relevant events, as they relate to the authentication key, such as logins, purchases, and so on.

   Additional data attributes for product IDs, SKUs, categories, content types, and so on.

   Provide to Amperity a dictionary of configurable **evar** fields that are in use.

#. A sample for each file to simplify feed creation.

   .. note:: Files sent from Adobe Analytics use Gzip as the compression format and will contain multiple files. 


.. tip:: Use SnapPass to securely share configuration details for |source-name| between your company and your Amperity representative.

.. _source-adobe-analytics-clickstream-files:

About clickstream files
==================================================

.. source-adobe-analytics-clickstream-files-start

Adobe Analytics can send data to the SFTP location that is built into Amperity. Adobe Analytics must be able to connect to this location, and then add files to the specified path.

.. source-adobe-analytics-clickstream-files-end

.. source-adobe-analytics-clickstream-files-schedule-start

When configured to run on a schedule, the output from Adobe Analytics is a compressed Gzip that contains multiple files. One of these files (**hit_data.tsv**) is the primary table and should be configured to run on a daily basis. All of the other files are static lookup tables for codes in the primary table.

.. source-adobe-analytics-clickstream-files-schedule-end


.. _source-adobe-analytics-add-data-source:

Add data source and feed
==================================================

.. source-adobe-analytics-add-data-source-intro-start-start

Add a data source that pulls data from an |source-name| bucket for each file that you want to pull to Amperity.

Browse the |source-name| bucket to select a file, and then review the settings for that file. Define the feed schema, and then activate the feed. Run the courier manually, and then review the data that is added to the domain table that is associated with the feed.

       Click **Browse** to open the **File browser**. Select the file that will be pulled to Amperity, and then click **Accept**.

       Use a filename pattern to define files that will be loaded on a recurring basis, but will have small changes to the filename over time, such as having a datestamp appended to the filename.

       .. note:: For a new feed, this file is *also* used as the sample file that is used to define the schema. For an existing feed, this file must match the schema that has already been defined.

          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       The contents of the file may be viewed as a table and in the raw format. Switch between these views using the **Table** and **Raw** buttons, and then click **Refresh** to view the file in that format.

       .. note:: PGP encrypted files can be previewed. Apache Parquet PGP encrypted files must be less than 500 MB to be previewed.

       Amperity will infer formatting details, and then adds these details to a series of settings located along the left side of the file view. File settings include:

       * Delimiter
       * Compression
       * Escape character
       * Quote character
       * Header row

       Review the file, and then update these settings, if necessary.

       .. note:: Amperity supports the following file types: |format_avro|, |format_parquet|, |format_csv|, DSV, |format_json|, |format_ndjson|, |format_psv|, |format_tsv|, and |format_xml|.

          Refer to those reference pages for details about each of the individual file formats.

          Files that contain nested JSON (or "complex JSON") or XML may require using the legacy courier configuration.

          :class: no-scaled-link
     - A feed defines the schema for a file that is loaded to Amperity, after which that data is loaded into a domain table and ready for use with workflows within Amperity.

       There are two options for feeds: use a new feed or use an existing feed.


       **Use a new feed**

       To use a new feed, choose the **Create new feed** option, select an existing source from the **Source** dropdown *or* type the name of a new data source, and then enter the name of the feed.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-new.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       After you choose a load type and save the courier configuration, you will configure the feed using the data within the sample file.


       **Use an existing feed**

       To use an existing feed, choose the **Use existing feed** option to use an existing schema.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-existing.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       This option requires this file to match all of the feed-specific settings, such as incoming field names, field types, and primary keys. The data within the file may be different.


       **Load types**

       The load type defines how data in the file will be loaded to the associated domain table.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-sources-add-04-feed-load-type.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Use the **Truncate and load** option to delete all rows in the associated domain table prior to loading data.

       Use the **Load** option to load data from the selected file to the associated domain table.

       .. note:: When a file is loaded to a domain table using an existing file, the file that is loaded *must* have the same schema as the existing feed. The data in the file may be new.


   * - .. image:: ../../images/steps-06.png
          :width: 60 px
          :alt: Step 6.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - Use the feed editor to do all of the following:

       * Set the primary key
       * Choose the field that best presents when the data in the table was last updated; if there is not an obvious choice, use the "Generate an updated field" option.
       * For each field in the incoming data, validate the field name and semantic tag columns in the feed. Make any necessary adjustments.
       * For tables that contain customer records, enable the "Make available to Stitch" to ensure the values in this data source are used for identity resolution.

       When finished, click **Activate**.


   * - .. image:: ../../images/steps-07.png

          :alt: Step 7.
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - Find the courier related to the feed that was just activated, and then run it manually.

       On the **Sources** page, under **Couriers**, find the courier you want to run and then select **Run** from the actions menu.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-courier-add-07-menu-run.png
          :width: 380 px
          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Select a date from the calendar picker that is before today, but after the date on which the file was added to the |source-name| bucket.

       .. image:: ../../images/mockup-courier-add-07-menu-load-data.png

          :alt: Add 
          :align: left
          :class: no-scaled-link

       Leave the load options in the **Run courier** dialog box unselected, and then click **Run**.

       After the courier has run successfully, inspect the domain table that contains the data that was loaded to Amperity. After you have verified that the data is correct, you may do any of the following:

       * If the data contains customer records, edit the feed and make that data available to Stitch.
       * If the data should be loaded to Amperity on a regular basis, add the courier to a courier group that runs on the desired schedule.
       * If the data will be a foundation for custom domain tables, use Spark SQL to build out that customization.

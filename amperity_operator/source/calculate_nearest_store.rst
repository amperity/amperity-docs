        Nearest store

==================================================
Nearest store
==================================================

.. calculate-nearest-store-start

Amperity can be configured to calculate the store that is nearest to an individual customer, as represented by their Amperity ID.

.. calculate-nearest-store-contact-support-start

.. important:: Nearest store calculations must be enabled for use in Amperity. This effort typically requires some customization and is not the same across tenants.

   Contact your Amperity support representative via the `Amperity Support Portal <../support/index.html>`__ (or send email to support@amperity.com) to discuss your options for adding nearest store capabilities to your tenant.

.. _calculate-nearest-store-requirements:

Requirements
==================================================

.. calculate-nearest-store-requirements-start

Calculating nearest store requires data to be provided to Amperity that includes the latitude and longitude for each store location. Amperity then uses a publicly available dataset to convert home zip codes to latitude and longitude. Amperity then uses the geographic center of each zip code to calculate the straight-line distance for the store nearest to the individual.

.. _calculate-nearest-store-calculated-fields:

Calculated fields
==================================================

.. calculate-nearest-store-calculated-fields-start

For each record in the customer 360 database, the following fields are added:

* nearest_store_id
* nearest_store_name
* nearest_store_distance_miles

.. _calculate-nearest-store-example:

Example
==================================================

.. calculate-nearest-store-example-start

A very simple example of calculating nearest stores starts with a common table expression that uses a `Haversine formula <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula>`__ |ext_link| to calculate latitude and longitude. United States zip codes are joined to a table that contains data about the physical location of stores, after which stores are ranked by distance. The store with the highest rank is the closest store.

.. caution:: This example is appropriate for use with small, static data sources, or for defining a proof of concept for early iteration that requires a more complex workflow.

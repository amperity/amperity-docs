==================================================
About storage
==================================================

.. storage-about-start

Amperity stores the following outputs in Amazon S3 storage or Azure Blob Storage, depending on the cloud platform in which your Amperity tenant is provisioned. These outputs include:

* Data that was ingested to Amperity, and then loaded to domain tables
* Tables that are maintained by Stitch
* Stitch reports
* Validation reports
* Database tables
* File uploads
* SQL results, including Spark SQL checkpoints
* Orchestration and campaign results
* User audit logs
* Conversations with Amp AI

.. _storage-configure-location:

Choose storage location
==================================================

.. storage-configure-location-start

The location in which Amperity stores outputs is configurable. The first step for a new tenant allows your brand to choose one of the following storage locations:

#. An :ref:`Amazon S3 storage location <storage-provision-location-aws>` that is owned and managed by your brand.

   **or**

   A :ref:`Microsoft Azure Blob Storage location <storage-provision-location-azure>` that is owned and managed by your brand.

#. An Amazon S3 storage location that is only used by your tenant that is provisioned automatically by default and managed by Amperity.

   **or**

   A Microsoft Azure Blob Storage location that is only used by your tenant that is provisioned automatically by default and managed by Amperity.

     - **Choose a storage location**

       #. Log in to the Amazon AWS console as a user with credentials that allow storage to be configured for your brand from within `AWS CloudFormation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html>`__ |ext_link|, such as an administrator.

          .. important:: When Amperity opens **AWS CloudFormation** during the storage setup process the IAM roles that are used for operations and role assumption within **AWS CloudFormation** is inherited from the IAM role that is assigned to the logged-in user.

       #. Log in to your Amperity tenant.

          .. note:: If your brand has chosen Amperity-managed storage the following setup workflow steps are skipped.

       #. The **Storage Setup** page appears.

     - **Specify regions**

       Specify the regions in which your brand wants to configure primary and backup storage, and then click **Continue**.

       Regions for configured storage should be the same regions in which Amperity is located.

       .. note:: Amperity is hosted in one of the following Amazon AWS regions:

          .. list-table::
             :widths: 50 50

          :align: center
          :class: no-scaled-link
     - **Create backup storage**

       Backup storage is provisioned using **AWS CloudFormation**.

       #. Click **Provision CloudFormation stack**. This opens the **Quick create stack** page in **AWS CloudFormation**.
       #. Provide the stack name.

          .. note:: The value for stack name is pre-populated by Amperity in the form of

             ::

                amperity-<tenant>-<infracode>-backup

             It is recommended to keep the pre-populated stack name.

       #. Optional. Configure the IAM role for **AWS CloudFormation** to *use for all operations performed on this stack*.

          .. note:: **AWS CloudFormation** will automatically use the credentials assigned to the user who is configuring the storage location.

       #. Review the parameters and configure the number of days for backups to be locked and retained.

          .. important:: The values for **InfraCode** and **Tenant** should not be changed.

       #. Optional. Configure the IAM role for **AWS CloudFormation** to *assume when performing operations on this stack*.

          .. note:: **AWS CloudFormation** will automatically use the credentials assigned to the user who is configuring the storage location.

       #. When finished, click **Create stack**.

          **AWS CloudFormation** will begin provisioning backup storage. This may take a few minutes.

          After provisioning for backup storage is complete return to the **Create backup storage** page in the storage setup workflow.

       #. On the **Create backup storage** page click **Continue**.

          :class: no-scaled-link
     - **Create primary storage**

       Primary storage is provisioned using **AWS CloudFormation**.

       .. important:: The values for primary storage are prepopulated using the information that was provided for backup storage. You may change these values in **AWS CloudFormation**, if necessary.

       #. The steps for configuring primary storage are nearly identical to backup storage. Click **Provision CloudFormation stack**, which opens the **Quick create stack** page in **AWS CloudFormation**. Provide a stack name, review IAM credentials and parameters, and then provision primary storage.

          .. note:: The value for stack name is pre-populated by Amperity in the form of

             ::

                amperity-<tenant>-<infracode>-storage

             It is recommended to keep the pre-populated stack name.

          .. important:: You must allow **AWS CloudFormation** to create IAM resources. Select the checkbox under "The following resources require capabilities [AWS::IAM::Role]".

       #. When finished, click **Create stack**.

          **AWS CloudFormation** will begin provisioning primary storage. This may take a few minutes.

          After provisioning for primary storage is complete return to the **Create primary storage** page in the storage setup workflow.

       #. On the **Create primary storage** page click **Continue**.

          :class: no-scaled-link
     - **Bind storage**

       After backup storage and primary storage are provisioned test the connection between Amperity and provisioned storage.

       #. Copy the value for the **AccessRole** for primary storage. Add the value to the **Access Role ARN** field in the **Bind storage** page. Click **Test connection**.

          .. tip:: The value for the access role ARN is found on the **Outputs** tab for the configured primary storage.
